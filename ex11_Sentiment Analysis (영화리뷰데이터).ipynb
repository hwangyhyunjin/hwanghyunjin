       " b'The worst part of this movie is how talented the cast is in everything else they\\'ve appeared in. In this, they are smug, self righteous and annoying. The main problem is, that they are trying to act like \"normal people\" and some of the most talented actors, just can\\'t pull that off. Philip Seymour Hoffman can definitely pull it off. Paul Giamatti can pull it off. These actors appear uncomfortable and really boring trying to be \"regular\" people in unusual situations, but even the situations are not that usual. The minority of people watching movies are actors or authors or whatever, so these situations don\\'t ring true and as the most annoying of all, Maggie Gyllenhall comes across as giggly and stupid, something that is sad to watch, given how talented she is. Trust THIS woman, do NOT watch this movie!!!',\n",
       " b\"I love this movie! I've seen it about four times, and every time I see it, Ramon Novarro gets cuter and cuter. He portrays the lazy and carefree islander to perfection, and Renee Adoree's performance is as heartbreaking as that in THE BIG PARADE. As a big fan of Donald Crisp, and used to his roles as kindly father figures, the lech he portrays in this film is a bit jarring, but he does an admirable job, considering he was really a big-hearted marshmallow. One of the greatest films in the twilight of the silent era.\",\n",
       " b'I have always been a huge James Bond fanatic! I have seen almost all of the films except for Die Another Day, and The World Is Not Enough. The graphic\\'s for Everything Or Nothing are breathtaking! The voice talents......... WOW! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN! He is finally Bond in a video game! HE IS BOND! I enjoyed the past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire. This one is definitely the best! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (may I call him Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes I can!) He was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game....... AT LONG LAST! DUH! I\\'ve seen him perform with Robin Williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( I mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor\\'s who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: \"Pierce Brosnan, thank you for being James Bond,\" \"If it wasn\\'t for you, I wouldn\\'t know who James Bond is.\" He\\'s a great actor! I am a huge fan of Willem Dafoe even though I\\'ve seen him in a couple of movies. His role as Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant. (Did I spell the character\\'s name right?) LOL!!!! He does a great job with an accent. Sometimes I can\\'t even hear an accent. I have seen Willem, I mean Mr. Dafoe, perform in two movies: Finding Nemo, and Spider-Man with my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! Anyway, He never ceases to amaze. And Richard Kiel, wow, he\\'s definitely got the part of Jaw\\'s nailed. I\\'ve seen him in the movie\\'s and he\\'s awesome! As a matter of fact, my Grandparent\\'s have met Mr. Kiel, and I was jealous when they told me. But, Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebritie\\'s that I want to meet. John Cleese was breathtaking. I have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating Q! Mr. Cleese was hilarious! I\\'ve seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. He\\'s awesome! John Cleese\\'s most recent project is Shrek 2 starring Mike Myer\\'s, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew\\'s and Eddie Murphy. ( Shrek 2 is now in theatre\\'s!) GOOD LUCK 007! Oh, yeah, and as Q alway\\'s says: \"Grow up 007!\"',\n",
       " b'Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie... Carrie Ann Moss as \"Mom\"?, even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /><br />\"...My father thied to eat me...

Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom..<br /><br />And don\\'t forget my head coffin<br /><br />And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just way cool!<br /><br />And yes, the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on. <br /><br />Sufice it to say, it all really works!',\n",
       " b'Well it\\'s not Gone with the Wind, that\\'s for sure! This movie features a woman with one change of underwear who apparently never leaves her apartment, and a bloke who looks better in a wedding dress than I ever did. Plus a mystic cab driver with nothing better to do than hang around waiting for them. And they don\\'t eat in three days.<br /><br />But leaving aside the practicalities, I enjoyed it immensely, although I\\'m not sure I can define why. My teen age kids bought me this DVD for Mother\\'s Day - or to be more exact, I bought it and instructed my kids to give it to me. My motives are probably too murky to discuss here. <br /><br />But having only seen David Wenham previously as Faramir in The Lord of the Rings, in drag as Audrey in Moulin Rouge and as the dubious Carl in Van Helsing ( a movie of quite excruciating badness), it was rather disconcerting to hear his real accent. I mean I knew in theory that Wenham was Australian, but hearing him sound quite so much like Richie Benaud, the cricket commentator whose dulcet tones take me straight back to childhood and my late father\\'s obsession with the thud of leather on willow, was almost more than I could handle.<br /><br />But I\\'m digressing. The movie. Lots of fun sex, which is always a good thing if well done, and this is pretty well done, especially towards the end of the movie as the couple really get into each other, lots of comments on men and women, (if a little clich\\xc3\\xa9d), and a happy ending, and it never takes itself too seriously. It is a little heavy handed in places - I\\'m thinking here of the close ups of the women\\'s mouths prior to the blow job in bath scene. Not subtle. Not a great work of art, but mildly erotic, entertaining and quite funny. <br /><br />And when evaluating their various past relationships, the script never plunges into the kind of overwrought pathos that would be obligatory in Hollywood. When Cin discovers the photo in Josh\\'s wallet, I was horribly afraid we\\'d get an explanation of the \"love of my life killed in a tragic auto wreck\" variety. Instead we get a quite refreshing \"she messed me about so I moved to London\" line. Real life, for all that it\\'s mundane.<br /><br />David Wenham does \"bemused everyman\" to perfection as Josh, and is obviously an actor of huge range. Susie Porter (who is gorgeous) is both vulnerable and tough where necessary as Cin. They look like real people, and seem just as dim-witted as the rest of us. I shall watch it again.',\n",
       " b'This film was not scary or creepy. It was a pathetic version of \"chuckie\", yet shorter. If you are looking for a decent horror movie, your not in the right area.It was an alright episode, but not if your looking for scary. It was unrealistic, more supernatural. Also quite bad acting if i must say. I would recommend, \\'The haunting in Kenetticut\\'. Its scary, mind-controlling. It is far more advanced then this excuse of a horror. I watched it with a group of friend, you\\'ll be looking round corners, closing curtains and leaving lights on. I leaves you with nightmares. I really think you should consider this as an alternative.',\n",
       " b\"Michael and Mark Polish have created a truly heartwarming film. I sat glued to the TV as I watched this video. My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world. Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.<br /><br />Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.<br /><br />Michele Hicks, her performance was awesome. She portrayed a true friend to both Blake and Frances, and a beautiful lover to Blake.<br /><br />Lesley Ann Warren - what can I say - you were magnificent. Your performance as the mother who was haunted by giving up her children was heartbreaking. Making amends is not always easy and in the case of your character, a very difficult scene to act.<br /><br />To the rest of the cast - I don't have enough room to write - you were all great!<br /><br />I give this movie a 10. It deserves more, but that's the highest I can vote.<br /><br />Thank you Michael and Mark Polish and all of the other actors, actresses, producers, directors, special effects, make-up artists, musicians, etc. that created one of the centuries best films.<br /><br />\",\n",
       " b'This was really one of my favorite films...serious and well-acted, particularly by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, taking nothing from the other fine actors in the cast. If I have any criticism at all, it would be that it should have been better edited. The last \"flashback\" scene in the film could have been eliminated and a good portion of the the train station scene when Earp looks for those who killed Morgan and injured Virgil. But then, that is the Director\\'s call and Kasdan couldn\\'t seem to let the project go. Costner was superb.',\n",
       " b'This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life has wrought on each of them. One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.<br /><br />This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.',\n",
       " b\"This one features all the (bad) effect of Prior's cheap-o movies, but is so overtly racist, nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature. Unless you plan to enlist in the Marines, skip this one. Oh, and even if you do, avoid it at all costs.\",\n",
       " b\"Most of this film shows the late Jeffrey Strouth, in the back seat of a car, talking and talking and talking and talking about his many unusual experiences. Either he has a huge, exaggeration-inflated imagination, or, he's one of those folks who is extremely often effected by planned and co-incidental timing, resulting in his involvement in a plethora of rare occurrences. In any event, I don't dispute the interestingness of his tales. But I sure did get tired of his banter: a style which others have characterized as queenish and effeminate. Sorry if I'm dwelling too much on delivery and not enough on substance. I'm not bothered by fingernails screeching on a chalkboard; but Jeffrey's rambling really turned me off - to the extent that I was unable to fully concentrate on the dialogue. Therefore, it's MY expectation that, in this case, the book must certainly be better than the movie.\",\n",
       " b\"I hate to bash anyone's work, but this is simply the WORST film ever. It would take far too long to list this film's problems, but suffice to say...you will be wasting your time and money on a terrible film.<br /><br />As far as the mother's killing their babies because of La Lorona, well that could have been handled in a terrifying but effective way (if it had to be handled), but this is not a thoughtful or sensitive treatment. It's not even a scary horror movie and the acting is so stiff - where was the director?<br /><br />As to why it was shot in New York City instead of Mexico, clearly there were budget issues. But location is the least of the problems. I wish there was something good to say about this film, but I couldn't find it.<br /><br />Maybe the film's writer/director or some cast/crew can post some positive comments...\",\n",
       " b'Well, basically, the movie blows! It\\'s Blair Witch meets Sean Penn\\'s ill conceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the \"War on Terror\" is really about. The script sounds like it was written by 8th grader (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things--but it just didn\\'t look like real documentaries I\\'ve watched), and worst of all Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd. I\\'d rather watch the Blair Witch VIII, than sit through that again.',\n",
       " b'Reading some of the reviews here reminds of some critic reviews of various children\\'s movies, wherein they complain about childish plots, low humor or movies that didn\\'t hold their attention, forgetting that they are, in fact, reviewing a children\\'s movie.<br /><br />This movie falls into similar areas, although it\\'s clearly not a children\\'s movie. It is meant to be a spoof, a parody, and it pokes fun at all kinds of people, be they Asian, Caucasian, African-American, Italian, or what have you. It\\'s not meant to be an Oscar candidate. It\\'s meant to be plain silly, slapstick fun. And in that regard, it\\'s perfect.<br /><br />No, Yune looks nothing like Bruce Lee. No, he\\'s not even Chinese. But therein lies the humor. It\\'s as much a send-up of Western stereotypes of Asians as anything (ever watch the \"Average Asian\" skits on MadTV with another Korean, Bobby Lee?).<br /><br />Overall, I have loved this movie every time I\\'ve seen it (although the sequel isn\\'t quite the classic), and I would rate it as a fall - out - of - my - seat - and - wet - myself type of comedy. You just have to let your mind go and enjoy it for what it is. Pure, silly, goofball slapstick... :)',\n",
       " b\"Here's my disclaimer: I am related to someone involved in the film, so I'm not completely unbiased. Having said that, I saw the preview at Sundance and I thought it was a great movie. The beginning really conveys a sense of how painfully disconnected and lacking direction Dave Tibble (Trevor Morgan) is. As the film progresses Ray Cook (Nick Nolte), in contrast to Dave's father (Timothy Hutton), shows Dave that whether or not you are completely successful the only way to really live life is to engage with its issues, without self-pity. The cast was all excellent, especially Nick Nolte; he was awesome in in this role. The conclusion of the film is bittersweet yet hopeful.\",\n",
       " b'Ben and Katie Jordan (played by Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfieffer) are in love...well, they WERE in love! After fifteen years of marriage and two children, the love is fading fast, and divorce seems like the only light bright light they see. While their children, Erin (Colleen Rennison) and Josh (Jake Sandvig) are away at summer camp, Ben and Katie tell about the highs and lows of their fifteen year marriage, and remember both the good times which seem to bring them closer again and the bad times, which totally tear them apart...again. Yet beyond the heated arguments between Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, there are Ben and Katie\\'s strong, passionate feelings for each other...which could possibly bring hope in saving their marriage.<br /><br />\"The Story of Us\" is a sappy love story for just about anyone! Okay, it\\'s not the BEST or most brilliant movies I ever seen, but perhaps, this film can teach valuable lessons of what true love is and of course that sometimes the bad times in a relationship of any kind can bring partners closer together...especially if they\\'ve been married for fifteen years!!! :) <br /><br />What I liked about this film was the moments of bubbly humour in which some of the characters brought on-screen (i.e. the ever annoying Andy and Joanie Kirby played by Bill Kirchenbauer and Lucy Webb during the \"I HATE THE KIRBY\\'S\" part of the movie), and the senseless fights between Ben and Katie. One thing\\'s for sure, you can easily see the guilt in their eyes after they fight! Yet that\\'s kind of cute! Though it\\'s obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!<br /><br />They kind of remind of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo from \"I Love Lucy\" only they are living in a different decade...they have more children...and they curse more (well...duh)! Yet like Ricky and Lucy, they seem to fight over stupid things, which is normal in any relationship, right? But of course...some of the issues they did fight over were kind of serious and maybe important to them personally. From Ben\\'s complaints about Dot (Katie\\'s mother) to Katie\\'s complaints about \"the other woman\" in which her husband denies. Kind of serious stuff...huh?<br /><br />Let\\'s put it this way: \"The Story of Us\" is a modern American love story with a heartwarming twist that you cannot ignore! Anyone would enjoy this movie...especially women and romance lovers! If you like novels by Danielle Steel or Sandra Brown or enjoyed films such as \"You\\'ve Got Mail\", \"Nine Months\", or \"Down To You\", you will like \"The Story of Us\"! Or...<br /><br />If you\\'re in for a good romance film in which you laugh or cry to or could sit back and relax, rent this movie! I\\'m not into these sappy, simple love stories some films have to offer, but I enjoyed this movie!!!...and you NEVER KNOW...maybe YOU will like it too!!! :)',\n",
       " b\"OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.<br /><br />The editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.<br /><br />Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all cost!\",\n",
       " b\"Although it is hated by most long time FF fans, I find 8 to be one of my favorites. With incredible graphics (the characters are a far cry from the blockyness of 7) and a new magic system, 8 also has an intreguing storyline that follows young squall around the world. Plus, the gunblade weapon is one of the coolest new weapons around, and the new limit break system makes for cool divergences from normally routine battle (if you have ever seen Squall's 'Lionhearted' limit break you know what im talking about.) Plus, it has truly the hardest enemy I have ever fought, the Omega Weapon, much harder than the final boss to say the least. Over all, it's a great game, and out of the whole series, it ranks number 2 in my book.\",\n",
       " b\".............this is nothing compared with the book of the same name. Occasionally you'll get movie/ miniseries conversions that are better than the book (Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, Misery, Stand By Me), some that are different to the book but ultimately on a par (Christine) but from the ones I've seen so far, more often than not they get completely lost in translation; this is a classic example. It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story. If you want to be entertained, I'd suggest going for the above title or maybe 'Storm of the Century'.\",\n",
       " b'This starts out with an alien spaceship being found during the blizt , a homage to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT no doubt but as the series progresses it comes more as an insult than a homage. I rate Nigel Kneale as television`s greatest ever writer and QUATERMASS AND THE PIT as the greatest drama ever to have been transmitted under the telefantasy banner and to have INVASION EARTH pay homage in this way is an obscenity . INVASION EARTH is possibly the worst telefantasy series ever made by the BBC . It is truly awful<br /><br />The script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They`re the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer`s journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens . All this is unnecessary to the plot , at least I think it is because I`m not sure what the plot is , describing the plot of INVASION EARTH is like describing the plot of a James Bond film , lots of things happen but none of it adds up to much. In which case I`ll say in INVASION EARTH not much happens and none of it makes much sense. Truly awful',\n",
       " b\"A young girls turning 18 and discovering her womanhood. Her older sister, willing to sacrifice her life in order to get her family out of poverty. Their father, an ill-tempered and drunken author with a severe case of writer's block. Their stepmother whose livelihood depends on closeness with an artist. One dashing American who can marry one sister and take the whole family out of its plight. The American's brother, who doesn't necessarily agree with his sibling's choice. Set the story in England in the 1930's and you've pretty much woven the tapestry for this lovely tale of poverty, hope, dreams and love.<br /><br />Cassandra, convincingly played by Romola Garai, is the pillar of this poor English family. A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back. During this maddening wait, Cassandra writes her most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary and brings us along the roller-coaster ride that is the passage from childhood to womanhood.<br /><br />The movie takes place in rural England, in an old castle. The camera work is fabulous. Blazing sunshine in good times and rain and clouds as life becomes more of a burden. The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.<br /><br />I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel, but I've yet to see a movie adaptation that was better than the book. By these standards, the novel must be a formidable read.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with English films. Being in North America, I've always heard that the English have a stiff upper lip and that they don't show any emotions. Yet, some of the most touching films and love stories I've seen were English (Sense and Sensibility comes to mind, here -- OK, Ang Lee isn't technically English but the screenplay and novel were; that's close enough in my book).<br /><br />If you like funny, emotional and touching stories, without the loud music, the fake emotions and the telegraphed ending, you will enjoy this film immensely.\",\n",

       " b'The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.<br /><br />One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. It doesn\\'t look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often Also, the characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of \"Moby Dick.\" When the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong. <br /><br />Overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years.',\n",
       " b'Well, I\\'ll start by admitting I\\'m not a John Ford fan. (I watched \"The Informer\" only because I\\'m trying to work my way through a list of the \"greats.\") So if you are, just move along, \\'cause you\\'re not going to agree with me.<br /><br />What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. I suppose it\\'s somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the \"talkies\" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) What dialogue there is usually has a \"They\\'re always after me Lucky Charms!\" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we\\'re in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.)<br /><br />Techniques change. Tastes change. So I won\\'t go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. But it\\'s not one of the classics that hold up --- more just \"fair warning\" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career.',\n",
       " b'David Lynch\\'s new short is a very \"Lynchian\" piece, full of darkness, tension, silences, discreet but very textured background music, and features again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurrent theme in his work.<br /><br />Both characters create a very intriguing slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in Mulholland Dr.<br /><br />Beautiful. For Lynch fan\\'s.<br /><br />',\n",
       " b\"I found it very interesting that almost only Hungarian people wrote reviews on this film.<br /><br />About the film: IMO this is a typical French comedy, with lots of embarrassing and silly but funny situations and decent acting. Belmondo is in top form, the ladies are OK. If you like French comedies this is right up your street.<br /><br />What makes this movie unforgettable for many of my fellow citizens is the extremely high quality of the Hungarian dubbing. I mean, I watched this film with the original sound and i have to tell you I didn't get half of the pleasure than watching it with the Hungarian voices.( In Hungary films on TV are usually dubbed and the standard of voice acting in the country was top notch for years. It's slowly declining nowadays, though, I'm afraid.)Many Hungarians know the entire script by heart and it's always a good party thing if you quote a line from this film. To us it's just fun.<br /><br />Like I said earlier this might not be your cup of tea. However, just for the laughs you can watch it on a day when there's not much to do(I wish I had more of them). It's impossible not to -at least- smiley on the lovely character played by Belmondo.\",\n",
       " b\"As romantic comedies go, this was a cute and winning one. I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. I hope to see them cast in more projects soon.<br /><br />Overall, this movie won't change your life, but is is sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.\",\n",
       " b\"This film opened in this country recently, right after another prison massacre in Brazil, where inmates were killed after they rioted.<br /><br />Hector Babenco's film is a sad commentary on society's failure to turn these criminals in jail, into law abiding citizens. If anything, this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison.<br /><br />Add to that the horrible conditions of jails in certain parts of the world. Any would be criminal should think twice about the consequence of their actions. Landing in a penal institution is a hellish experience, at best. How can lawmakers of the world think that a criminal mind will be changed by sending them to places such as Carandiru? If anything, placing these criminals with other criminals in such conditions will perpetuate crime and if the prisoner survives the term, he will be scarred for life.<br /><br />Not having read the book in which this film is based, it is only fair to say that Mr. Babenco, an excellent director, has given us a realistic film about what hell must be like.\",\n",
       " b\"I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. <br /><br />The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Even the little moments just melt your heart. <br /><br />This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. A masterpiece.\",\n",
       " b\"Hausu is a horror comedy which depicts the subtle art of Japanese film-making. The scare factor here does not lie on the visuals, but more on the emotions of the characters, Oshare, the teenage girl who lost her Mom and eventually reunited with her father during her vacation. Her bliss faded when her father introduced her to her stepmother. That disappointing fact made her change to be sullen, and started writing letters to her aunt, and that was the start of her journey with her bunch of friends to the mysterious house.<br /><br />The loss of a loved one, being in solitude, hoping for broken promises are the every person's fears that are hard to recognize. Amidst the funny visuals and average effects,(what can we expect from the technology in 1970s and movie-making is not that much better as we have it now) the movie wants to impart these things and I believe this what makes this film worth seeing and truly a classic.\",\n",
       " b\"This one works on several levels, that may not all be apparent to the casual viewer. It delves into the sci-fi area of the fear and apprehension of the new and strange unfamiliar technologies that did, do and always will cause mankind to shudder to think of just what our role will be in the future. This parallels the then current political idea of a society that would be best ruled by scientists, engineers and the like. Known as 'TECHNOCRACY', this system neither had much room nor any sympathy for the human side of things, too inefficient.<br /><br />Secondly, the inclusion of the Satanist cult is both a throw back to old Gothic type horror tales of witches, ghosts and the supernatural. This is a link to the vampire and werewolf, and is a horror that cannot be more universal (not Universal!). Fear of the occult.<br /><br />Thirdly, the element of the story that is perhaps the most pertinent to our 'modern' world. The Mansion,which serves as the setting for most of the film, is built on the sight of a great World War I battle, in which countless thousands lost their lives. This in the end is probably the most horrifying (and truthful) element. When combined with the blood-letting and cruelties of man to fellow man that are portrayed as the climax to the film, the movie sounds both a condemnation of what has transpired in the previous part of the 20th century, WWI, and the unthinkable atrocities that were to come.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a story of a girls quest to become a Musketeer like her father D'Artagnan. It's very entertaining and suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />We all like Susie Amy who plays Valentine D'Artagnan, very much. Thought all the young musketeers were great and it was a lovely contrast with the older characters, their fathers. I am a big Michael York fan so it was good to see him back as D'Artagnan.<br /><br />It could be a bit storytelling at times, but that is needed for younger viewers. The fight sequences could be slightly repetitive and many of the action movies are, but they were well done.<br /><br />Think from reading other information, this wasn't filmed as a movie but as a TV mini series so it is quite long to watch in one sitting.<br /><br />But all in all, what you'd expect, not difficult to follow but entertaining viewing for the family.\",\n",
       " b\"Tarantino and Rodriguez are two of my favourite directors but this film still left me cold. Maybe it was because I was expecting so much. When I was told about the film it sounded great -four rooms, four directors- two of which I loved. But sadly as is always the case when you expect something brilliant you rarely feel satisfied, and for me this was an extremely unsatisfying film.<br /><br />Out of the whole cast there were only 3 characters I liked - the 2 kids in The Misbehaviors and Marisa Tomei. For me the rest were at best boring and at worst irritating to the point of actual anger. I really like Tim Roth, normally, but his character actually made me angry, he was so irritating and slapstick that I wanted him to get killed in some horrendous way, something I never wish for the protagonist of a film. Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.<br /><br />This is just my opinion and is of course subject to change as maybe if I watched it again at the right time and in the right mood I may see something I missed and get what all the people who enjoyed the movie got. I don't think I could take the risk though.\",\n",

Preysing is certain that the only way Otto can afford to stay at that swanky and expensive joint is that he embezzled his business. Otto gets his by now hot in the collar boss even madder at him by stealing his pretty stenographer Flaemmchen or Flaem for short, Joan Crawford, who sees what a creep her, like Otto\\'s, boss the Iron Prussian-like Preysing really is.<br /><br />The movie \"Grand Hotel\" also has as one of its guests the flat broke and compulsive gambler Baron Felix Von Geigern, John Barrymore. Baron Felix lost his entire fortune playing baccarat and is now in danger of getting his legs broken if he doesn\\'t come up with the cash, 5,000 Marks, that he owes the \"Boys\" who\\'ve been backing up his losing bets.

This is done by Baron Felix in order to get back the money he owes the \"Boys\" before the \"Boys\" who\\'ve just about had it with him, in his stalling to pay them back their money, end up making him a cripple.

Being both wholesome and sensuous Miss. Crawford was able to put the grubby and aggressive Preysing in his place. This was by showing him that the person whom he held in contempt, and was a rival for her affections, the sweet and soft speaking Otto was a bigger success, as a human being, that he\\'ll ever be. <br /><br />In the end the so sure of himself Preysing ended up being lead out of the Grand Hotel in handcuffs and going to jail for crimes committed by him on and off the premises.

       " b\"High heels are tricksy things. They can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.<br /><br />Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. The best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.<br /><br />There's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from Almod\\xc3\\xb3var, but otherwise Tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse.

       " b'Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /><br />The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, \"George Grisby,\" is one of the strangest people I\\'ve ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone isn\\'t far behind in the \"strange\" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles\\' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /><br />Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /><br />This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.',\n",
       " b'Adrian went all out for this lavish, gorgeous production of \"Marie Antoinette\" starring Norma Shearer, who is never more beautiful or glamorous than in this epic biography. This Marie is quite the heroine, a woman of the people, generous to a fault, and never says, \"Let them eat cake,\" and would only have said it in reference to her children. History tells us that Marie\\'s downfall was really the \"Affair of the Necklace,\" and she was no different from other aristocrats in being totally out of touch with what was going on with the French people.<br /><br />This film is jaw dropping in its splendor. Adrian\\'s costumes are totally magnificent, as are the palace settings. Tyrone Power is drop-dead gorgeous as Marie\\'s Swedish lover, who comes to her aid in her time of need. Power was the inspiration for Barbara Cartland to say, when asked how she could write so convincingly about sex while she was a still a virgin, \"We didn\\'t need sex. We had Tyrone Power.\" The rest of the cast is fantastic, including Robert Morley, John Barrymore, Joseph Schildkraut, and Gladys George. As for Norma, she does a great job, giving a vivid, if movie star, performance in one of her last films. The last scenes are very touching and beautifully done.<br /><br />I had no expectations for this film and as a rule am not crazy about period pieces, but this one swept me away. It does follow history quite closely - for those who commented that the Tyrone Power character was fictional, he was not, and he did try to help her.<br /><br />Don\\'t miss this one.<br /><br />**A funny Marie Antionette anecdote: The studio wanted Shearer to use their contract star, Robert Taylor, but Shearer got a look at Power at a dinner, invited him to be part of the film, and got her way. During their first kiss, she held on so long the kiss had to be edited down. Power apparently did not return her affections. She became angry. At a photo shoot, she appeared with gigantic plumes that hid him as he posed behind her and the plumes shot up. The photographer gave Power a box to stand on. As the photographer activated the flash, Power crashed through the box and hit the floor. Though he escorted Shearer to the premier, he snuck out to see his soon to be wife, Annabella.',\n",
       " b\"This movie is BAD! It's basically an overdone copy of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, only worse! The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint, freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling. I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie.\",\n",
       " b\"If you're going to look after a child, make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard. Especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her 'friends'. But, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the Nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter. Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths. But enough of that.. domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones. Oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.<br /><br />In fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they'd signed up for and gone AWOL. Yes, I know it's hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you'd want. If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting. Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress Rosalie Cole (The next Dakota Fanning she ain't) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.<br /><br />This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on. But back up a minute.. earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it. So do they stay where they are safe? No of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />Finally, the film closes. It doesn't end, it just goes to a grinding halt. The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened. But, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened. You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you're ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Just think.. years from now on your deathbed, what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family. Sadly, it's already too late for me. Don't you make the same mistake :( 2/10\",\n",
       " b\"Cheesy melodrama set during the time after the fall of Battista in Cuba. While the film has a man shot in the airport for crimes that a never specified this film seems to be a starting point for Hollywood's fixation with tin pot Latin American dictators/despots. In this film the bad guys are the supporters of Battista and the law abiding guys are working for the Castro Government. The only thing missing is a rally for Che. Not a very good film the acting is surprisingly wooden. I had a lot of good memories of Cameron Mitchell but this film made me question my recollections. The film was obviously shot on sets and very little location work is done. The dialog is uninspiring, and unlike other films of this era this film is not much fun to watch.\",\n",

At least, that's what Sheriff Lyndon Harris finds when he spots a truck full of the insects crash. He must try to warn the people of his town before a Honey Festival (a really lame excuse to attract the bees) takes place.<br /><br />Even the '70s thriller 'The Swarm' had better special effects than this, probably because the makers didn't automatically switch to a digital solution every time a stunt was involved.<br /><br />All in all, the acting is terrible, the plot is awful and the best special effect in the whole movie is the farmer's decomposing body after he swallows a bee in his beer.\",\n",

But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs. And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. But it could be much better.\",\n",
       " b'Isabel Allende\\'s magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive Latin mellifluousness of Allende\\'s characters, and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make certain I had not missed something vital that might change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed a thing. None among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director Bille August. All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, by putting forth as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets. (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of its life.) Curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before KFC came into being. Back then, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardoning that, what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. \"The House of the Spirits\" should have been the motion picture event of 1993. Because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have pressed charges for rape.',\n",

Why does everything look so weathered in an underground bunker?), one major flaw sticks out at me (!MAJOR SPOILER HERE STOP!) as the three are escaping, they exit VIA this kind of log ride DOWN several tall chutes... yet somehow they emerge several hundred meters above the city and are able to look directly down on it.

       " b'I went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack-and-slash films rampant on the screen these days. Boy, was I surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber, dark atmosphere. More surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As with most good movies, this one leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a superb job at directing. Scenes shot inside the car as are well done and, after watching the \"Anatomy of a Scene\" episode at the end of the video tape, It was good to see that some of the subtle, yet wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just an \"Oh, that looks good, keep it\" type of direction. This is a moody movie, filled with grimness. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (Okay, I\\'ve always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never goes over the top. Au Contraire, it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film. If there is any one area where this film lacks, it is in the ending, which seems just a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. What is the message? It\\'s something that each individual decides for themself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie: \"Body Heat\" or \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\"), and about a 5 for those who don\\'t.',\n",

       " b\"When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.<br /><br />So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat. A disparate group of passengers and crew are torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and wind up together in a lifeboat. After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them. The last one picked up on board is a German.<br /><br />The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.<br /><br />Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.<br /><br />The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.<br /><br />Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.<br /><br />The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic.\",\n",

Actors Lemmon and Dennis each do an impeccably hilarious job. Lemmon, again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and Dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. Neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this.<br /><br />On the Remake: Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn reprised the Kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable Simon original script. <br /><br />There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to. <br /><br />Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.\",\n",
       " b'What always impresses me about Zhang Yimou\\'s *Shanghai Triad* is how the two settings of the film -- the Thirties-era, glitzy nightclub milieu of the gangsters in Shanghai and the pastoral scene in the second half -- are used as a counterpoint to the drama unfolding before us. The settings are glamorous, mythical, beautiful; the people are not.<br /><br />The characters are, in fact, brutally ordinary. Even the ostensible hero of the piece, the 14-year-old boy who becomes the servant of chanteuse Gong Li, is not particularly remarkable: not intuitive, not very smart, and certainly not a winner. Ineffectual to the end, he ends up suspended upside-down like the famed Hanged Man in a deck of Tarot. The plot involving the Thirties-era Shanghai Mafia is mostly presented through the boys\\' eyes, with the result that the most \"action-oriented\" events, usually occurring off-screen, seem incoherent and, though violent and tragic, beside the point. The Boss\\'s girlfriend Gong Li obsesses us to the same degree that she devours the boy. All else -- meaning, the plot\\'s wider macrocosm -- remains tangential or dangerously opaque. It turns out that there is plenty enough drama in the day-to-day life of the gangster\\'s moll, played by Gong Li with a seemingly infinite variety: shallow, slutty, heartbroken, tragic, pathetic, whimsical, tender. The poor boy is in a dither. One minute he hates her enough to spit in her tea when her back is turned; the next he smiles at her childish singing like the first fool in love in the history of the world. (By the way, let it be said that I would\\'ve had my left ear cut off if given the chance to be Li\\'s boy-servant!)<br /><br />\"Miss Bijou\" could almost have become a real human being if permitted just a few more weeks on the island. The snotty poisons appear to ooze away from her; the rustic setting puts her back in touch with a girlish freedom, almost forgotten (and hardly suspected by us). In several of Shakespeare\\'s plays, there exists what his critics call a \"green world\" -- a haven far away from the corruptions of urban life. Zhang permits us brief glimpses of decency that are engendered by this potentially healing \"green world\", all under the nose of the ruthless crime lord (who is ostensibly there to heal from his knife wound, as well). These glimpses are so powerfully touching that we tend to forget the Boss\\'s evil eminence, and therefore the machinations of the gangsters -- never forgotten by THEM, of course -- intermittently slap us awake.<br /><br />All of which is another way of saying that Yue Lu\\'s cinematography is almost too astonishing for the movie\\'s subject. *Shanghai Triad* is, without question, one of the most beautiful-looking movies of the Nineties, perhaps of all time. But don\\'t let the beauty of the pictures, or Gong Li\\'s physical charms, for that matter, distract you from the preciseness of Zhang\\'s direction. Obliged to commit to the idea of subjective camera placement (that is, generally taking the perspective of the boy), Zhang evinces great subtlety and restraint. For instance, he uses the Steadicam here, but doesn\\'t get carried away with it in order to create some sort of mood or tone, the way Kubrick was prone to do. Zhang knows when to move the camera, and he knows when to keep the damn thing still: it depends on what each scene calls for. Every frame of this film is directed to a specific aesthetic purpose.<br /><br />By the way, this movie makes a natural double-bill with Hou Hsiao-Hsien\\'s *Millennium Mambo*, another exercise in exquisite aesthetics with a plot about a gangster\\'s moll. One wonders if Hou wasn\\'t a bit tainted by the influence of *Shanghai Triad*, despite *Mambo*\\'s 21st-century setting. Both films are about inarticulate, helpless satellites in a criminal universe who come to depressing ends. Needless to say, these films could only have been made in China or Taiwan, home to a culture more ruthlessly realistic than our sappy civilization. If remade as an American film, the Boss in *Shanghai Triad* would have developed a sentimental attachment to the kid which would inevitably bring his criminal empire crashing down around his head. Imagine the reverse, and you\\'ll get the idea of how THIS film ends.<br /><br />All in all, one of the classics of modern Chinese cinema. 9 stars out of 10.',\n",
       " b\"The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself.

It's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile, because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast, you don't get an idea of what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It isn't one of the great all-time classics, but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       " b'I\\'m always suspicious of films with many titles. I invariably find myself musing as to why the film can be found under so many guises. Could it be that the film is absolutely awful, so its makers and distributors have re-named it and re-marketed it again and again in the hope of eventually finding an appreciative audience? This is such a film - a Euro horror zombie flick which has more alternative titles than cast members! The version I saw was entitled \"Beyond The Living Dead\", and most of the cast members were given nondescript pseudonyms on the credits. For instance, hero Stelvio Rosi was billed as Stanley Cooper, and principle female player Dyanik Zurakowska was billed as Vickie Nesbitt. It\\'s not a particularly good film, but to whole-heartedly savage it would be a touch harsh as there are just a few interesting elements which drag it up above \"awful\" to somewhere in the \"slightly-below-average\" category.<br /><br />Serge Checkhov (Stelvio Rosi) arrives in an East European town (Skopje in Macedonia is hinted at) for the reading of his uncle\\'s will. He soon discovers that he is to inherit his uncle\\'s mansion, much to the annoyance of his cruel and ambitious aunt Nadia (Maria Pia Conte). Something creepy seems to be going on in town at the same time - his cousin is found hanged from a tree in the cemetery; necrophiliac grave-digger Igor (Paul Naschy) starts to act more outlandishly than usual; Aunt Nadia seduces and copulates with young Serge; a doctor residing in the house starts to show off his experiments to reanimate dead animals; and uncle\\'s corpse occasionally goes missing as if it\\'s got up and begun walking of its own accord. Gradually, Serge investigates and uncovers a plot that Baron Frankenstein himself would\\'ve been mighty proud of.<br /><br />Mainly the film is underwhelming. The solution to the mystery is revealed in a phony, heavy-handed scene which resembles the unmasking of the villain in a Scooby Doo cartoon. Sometimes the characters say and do such dumb things that you want to scream in despair. The performances are generally amateurish, and the film is thin on real terror. However, as I\\'ve indicated already, it escapes total damnation for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Naschy as the necrophiliac grave digger is hilarious and disturbing (at the same time) in all his scenes. Secondly, the location work is quite impressive. Thirdly, there\\'s plenty of needless nudity to please the voyeurs (check out the scene where Zurakowska bares her tits purely for the hell of it.... a free drink for anyone who can justify the need for THAT scene without using the word exploitation!!!) And fourthly, for some reason that I\\'ve never been able to figure out, the preposterous story is actually engrossing in a totally inexplicable way. Beyond The Living Dead - or whatever title you know it by - is undoubtedly a bad film, but at least it\\'s ENTERTAININGLY bad.',\n",
       " b\"You Can't Cheat An Honest Man finds widower W.C. Fields running a second rate circus and trying to stay one step ahead of the law as he's creditors just about every place he goes. His children, John Arledge and Constance Moore attend a really posh Ivy League type school and you sympathize with Fields because you know this why he's probably not paying his bills. One also can speculate what his wife must have put up with back in the day.<br /><br />Moore on a visit to Dad's show falls for the ventriloquist sideshow performer Edgar Bergen. But Bergen doesn't really get along with Fields or I should say his alter ego Charlie McCarthy doesn't.<br /><br />The Fields-McCarthy feud was legendary on radio and it might seem hard to fathom how a ventriloquist could entertain on radio. But the characters he created were so powerful and had such a hold on the minds of the public that they were real. Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd were characters in their own right, they almost but not quite gained separate identities away from Edgar Bergen.<br /><br />Anyway on Bergen's show, Bill Fields was a frequent guest and the repartee between Fields and McCarthy is still classic. Even without knowing that background, today's audience can still enjoy You Can't Cheat an Honest Man because the comedy is eternal.<br /><br />There's not much of a plot except for Moore loving Bergen, but being ready to marry snobbish James Bush to help her father in his financial troubles. I'm sure you can figure out how that goes, especially when prospect in-laws Thurston Hall and Mary Forbes meet Fields at a little clambake they're throwing.<br /><br />The circus offers a range of opportunity for some great gags including trying to pry Charlie McCarthy out of an alligator, an elephant who gives Fields showers on command and of course sawing Charlie in half during a magic act.<br /><br />Still it's the repartee between Fields and Bergen and another of the unforgettable characterizations that Bill Fields brings us which makes You Can't Cheat An Honest Man a comedy classic.\",\n",
       " b\"Are you kidding? Dawn of the Dead was such an entertaining flick, by no means an Oscar Winner but certainly a well thought out display of zombie gore and emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters.. Dawn of the Dead even ended well, paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what's to come for the characters at the end of the movie. Day of the Dead is not that sequel.<br /><br />Day of the Dead is almost laughably terrible. The acting is shallow and boring at best. Yes, Ving Rhames is in this, but somehow the producers managed to make Ving look amateurish and uncomfortable. Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie. <br /><br />The zombies look fake and in no way menacing. The editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly, by the end of the movie I was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed. The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. Try again Steve Miner and Jeffrey Reddick.\",\n",

I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie. The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless. A watered down version of Baraka, which is the same idea but done better. I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.\",\n",

       " b'Greetings again from the darkness. Pretty interesting look behind the curtain of the world of crosswords ... in particular the New York Times crossword editor, Will Shortz.<br /><br />What is not really surprising is the combination of ego and insecurity that plague the top contenders in the annual contest. These traits rear their head at any and every competition, regardless of topic or sport. What is surprising is the sportsmanship involved when there is an apparent major scoring error in the semi-finals. Watching the competitors band together against the committee is something not usually seen in the sporting and gaming world. These guys want the competition to be fair ... no cheap wins. I wonder if Pat Reilly or Bobby Knight would feel the same way? As you might expect the traditional nerd factor is at play here and the filmmakers do a nice job of mixing in some pretty faces to balance the picture. Mike Mussina, Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart are all thrown in to show that all walks of life are addicted and not everyone that is addicted looks like the reclusive nerd we all knew in high school. The most fascinating character in what story there is, is the twenty year old hot shot that most think is too young and inexperienced to really compete at the top. Just as interesting though is the way the more traditional powerhouses react to his presence and apparent skill.<br /><br />There is a nice peak at the collaborative efforts that go into the creation of the puzzle, even though Mr. Shortz leaves little doubt that it is his responsibility ... hate mail and all. Very nice look into a world that most of us give little thought to.',\n",

A man finally returns from Spain from decades of self-exile during the Franco years, and reunites with an old flame. Could have been good in the hands of a Mike Leigh, but with this script and director it was a snoozefest. Almost nothing happens. For some reason, \"Das Boot,\" which had more drama in any given two minutes of its running time than \"Volver a empezar\" in its entirety, couldn\\'t be nominated and then selected.

If you can not get Snatch then may be go on and watch this one. But spend as little money as possible. There are few scenes in the movie which are funny, but they the rest are utter garbage. The changed story line doesn't suit the Indian climate. Music is not so good, acting is not up to mark. I wont say anything much about this.<br /><br />Watch on your risk, or to be safe watch original movie 'Snatch'.\",\n",

       " b'The 1947 mystery-thriller,\"The Two Mrs.Carrolls\"is considered by many critics to be a tepid,unrealistic film and one of Humphrey Bogart\\'s lesser works. This couldn\\'t be more false. The film contains brilliant performances by Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck,a great deal of eerie suspense,and delicious bits of English humor. The plot of the film is similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock\\'s \"Dial M for Murder\" and \"Suspicion\",but has a uniqueness all it\\'s own. It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies. Life is normal for them,until Sally begins to feel ill and restless quite often.A doctor says she\\'s suffering from nothing more than a nerve condition,and she believes that\\'s all it is. She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey\\'s precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called \"The Angel of Death\",was done while she was sick. Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey\\'s next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband\\'s evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn\\'t go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as \"The Maltese Falcon\"or \"Key Largo\",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint. I give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.<br /><br />',\n",
       " b'Well, it\\'s an interesting premise, but the director misses most of the opportunities it offers, managing only a handful of suspenseful moments.

They don't really appeal to me, so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations.

       " b'Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks \"What\\'s with SNITCH\\'D\" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film.<br /><br />Let me clarify some points regarding this \"interesting life experience\".<br /><br />Originally, SNITCH\\'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG\\'s notorious Experimental Feature contract. But I digress...<br /><br />I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI... I too believed the myth back then.<br /><br />Let\\'s just chalk it up as \"film school\" for many involved, myself included. SNITCH\\'D was shot over two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, he is a Drama and English teacher...consider THAT while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast.<br /><br />Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A.\\'s Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and \"let\\'s do this\" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come. <br /><br />SNITCH\\'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.<br /><br />Anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to lend credibility to SNITCH\\'D. Since Cahill\\'s other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it\\'s cover... as so many have picked up this DVD based on it\\'s sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent. <br /><br />6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.',\n",
       " b'First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews. I never played the game so I had no idea what to expect.<br /><br />I should know better...<br /><br />I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, sat down with a low expectation, and cranked up my Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system. Was I ever BLOWN away! It was more than I expected and the characters were not as \"forgettable\" as some critics said. I found the performances of Tcheky Kanyo (Paladin) and David Warner (Admiral Tolwyn) were memorable. Saffron Burrows (Angel) was great, except that she handled her \"crisis\" at the end rather badly. But overall the movie was a treat. I would recommend it for anyone to at least rent this and check it out!',\n",

       " b\"The Boss, filmed from a script by the blacklisted and hence uncredited Dalton Trumbo, starts in 1919 and ends somewhere in the Great Depression. It's about the corruption of a municipal machine that focuses on demobbed doughboy John Payne who, when his older brother dies, inherits his political clout. <br /><br />On the night of his return he godrunk and married a stranger he comes to scorn (Gloria McGhee, whomakes you yearn for more of her). His only unwavering loyalty lies withan old wartime buddy (William Bishop), who has married the girl Payne loved. So all his passion goes into strengthening his hold over the city, including forging an unholy alliance with the (unnamed) Mafia.<br /><br />Despite a precisely staged shootout in the train depot (did Brian De Palma borrow from this as well as from The Battleship Potemkin, for The Untouchables?), The Boss is really a somewhat Kane-ish look at the rise and fall of a lone wolf; Payne's tough yet touching performance lends an almost tragic tinge. The result is an involving period piece that dwells on the late fringes of film noir. <br /><br />(One topical note: the men's costumes were by Dick Cheney.)\",\n",
       " b'\"The Widow of St. Pierre (Veuve de Saint-Pierre)\" is a very unconventional relationship triangle, with resonances of \"Dead Man Walking.\" <br /><br />Juiliette Binoche is much more interesting and complex here than she is in \"Chocolat\" as a Lady Bountiful who is pushing redemption with more than a tinge of sensuality.<br /><br />Daniel Auteil who usually plays hapless contemporary men at first looks as out of place in a period costume drama as Harvey Keitel does, but he brings the intellectual and moral sensibility of the 20th century to a true story from an earlier one.<br /><br />Love and devotion--to a spouse and to duty-- are quietly played out against sophisticated political gamesmanship of a small town. <br /><br />The cinematography in Atlantic Canada is beautiful; the pregnant pause close-ups are as claustrophobic as living on the island outpost. It was partly filmed at one of my all-time favorite historic recreations at Louisbourg in Cape Breton, Newfoundland. <br /><br />(originally written 3/18/2001)',\n",

The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam.

       " b'This film made me so very angry. Like a gruesome train wreck, this film is definitely captivating ... in the worst kind of way. As you watch, you realize that you will never get those 24 minutes back.<br /><br />The film, contrary to some opinions, is a random jumble of pseudo-psychological images and scenes laden with tacky Freudean cues. This is simply weird for the sake of being weird--not some deep, insightful treatise. This is someone\\'s idea of what a \"post-modern\" short student film is supposed to be. There is no real substance here. Notice that the previous reviewer, Rick Hancox, claims that there is a \"strong message\" though he neglects to mention what that may be. No offense to Mr. Hancox, he is much more optimistic than I.<br /><br />This film is offensive, in that the people involved in making are obviously talented people with some ability at making films. However, this ability is squandered on such trite, self-indulgent crap.<br /><br />Please, for the love of God, don\\'t subject yourself to this. Unless you are interested in knowing what Alex de Large must have felt like after undergoing \"therapy\" in \"A Clockwork Orange\".',\n",
       " b'There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick\\'s abundance of clich\\xc3\\xa9s throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.<br /><br />I\\'d read about Elizabeth Berkly\\'s awful performance in the equally-awful \"Showgirls,\" which I\\'ve never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime\\'s worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn\\'t have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn\\'t a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.<br /><br />The principal\\'s handling of Liz\\'s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband\\'s initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny\\'s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally-challenged).<br /><br />The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.<br /><br />Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you\\'d rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the \"Law and Order\" series\\', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on \"Lifetime.\"<br /><br />Finally, I found a kind of \"story within a story\" fascination with Josh\\'s concoction of his being the \"victim\" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from \"F\" to \"F-minus.\"<br /><br />This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour\\'s blank film in the camera. <br /><br />But the writer(s) here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally \"resolved\" and \"righted,\" this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any \"real world\" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.<br /><br />This one\\'s a 2* presentation; the second \"*\" because it does have some mild \"fascination.\"',\n",
       " b'The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, gratuitous sex and nudity, murder and mayhem... on paper Tobe Hopper\\'s Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. It\\'s not. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.<br /><br />There aren\\'t too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the \"When you\\'re as criminal as I\" bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.',\n",

I truly am a fan.<br /><br />However, I can\\'t help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" is lost in translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. Ultimately though this one just didn\\'t work. <br /><br />It wasn\\'t that the characters weren\\'t well developed or the plot and content didn\\'t come alive. It\\'s just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. We\\'re taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author\\'s precision. Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here.<br /><br />I suggest reading the book!',\n",

He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married.<br /><br />This movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy too.<br /><br />The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the Strangler.<br /><br />Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.\",\n",

No investigation, trial, psychiatric evaluations - just taken in by idiots. Along comes reporter Terence Knox, who's having a terrible road trip with it estranged son. They decide to stay in town so dad can get the story and son can act like a whiny punk. Soon enough, the freaky Gatlin kids start getting' religious again and kill a few adults. No one seems to notice they all stand in a pack and brood next to the person who ends up dead. Most of the idiot town gets burned alive at a town meeting but not before some toxic corn subplot is introduced. The movie ends with a good old-fashioned showdown.<br /><br />In spite of a few decent gore scenes, the grossest scene in the movie is a Terence Knox sex scene that may hold the record for fake sweat in a mainstream movie. Actually, I'm still not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or not.\",\n",
       " b'After hearing about this documentary on the right-wing radio show, Steve Brown Etc., I thought that I\\'d take a look. Was I ever impressed. Essentially, the movie sets out to expose problems within the gay community and their \"pride events\" in relation to charities. The concept at first glance can make gay people very angry about airing their \"dirty laundry\" and rightfully so. Robert Labby (one of the main characters) was trying to do a religious activity in the middle of Sadom and Gamora and failed. What I thought was most important was that this seemed to be a continuing theme. In the lesbian wedding segment we see the preacher from the Joy MCC church conducting the ceremony, after himself admitting that he too is gay. I don\\'t know what the filmmaker\\'s intentions were, but inadvertently he\\'s created a wonderful illustration of how lost homosexual culture is, even beyond the typical stereotypes of drug abuse and sex addiction. It shows the culture to be apathetic and having the misplaced arrogance of a petulant child. There is nothing about the movie that reaches for situations where homosexuals illustrate how misguided their lifestyle is, all of it is natural and undoctored.<br /><br />surprisingly, Robert Labby, the gay promoter documented in the film, was the guest on the Steve Brown Show, not any of the filmmakers. This made me curious to see what the movie was about. How could a gay man fighting for gay rights come down so hard on his own people? The answer is very clear if you see Selling Queer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this picture.',\n",
       " b\"This film is awful. The writing is tolerable but the acting is atrocious. The director was so in love with his own infantile pathos that he includes long long shots of guys looking tragic. If this film had a competent editor, it might have achieved mediocre status. As we saw with the Da Vinci Code, when the main actor is flat or bad, no matter what you do the rest of the movie will fail. And the main actor is not just bad, he is utterly inept. Think of the pathetic attempts at dialog in the 12 seconds of every porn film prior to getting down to business--our main actor is as bad if not worse than that. <br /><br />The only reason I am even bothering to write this review is to talk about the love interest in the film, David Vincent. So far as I can tell, this is his only credit. That's a shame. His performance was subtle and nuanced. If this was his only acting credit, he could have quit his day job and made it as an actor. In the extras on the DVD you can see him reading for another part, the part of the hook up at the very end of the film. That scene in the film is particularly pathetic and tonally wrong; but from the screen test, you can see that if David Vincent had played that part, he could have carried it off with aplomb. Wherever you are, David Vincent, there is no doubt that you could have had a career in film.<br /><br />As for the rest of the folks, including the director, don't quit your day jobs.\",\n",
       " b\"this is the kind of pussy film that women love. all the females are good, and all the men are evil. no exceptions here. except for kids, of course, who are always virtuous in these American family films.<br /><br />the most important virtue is fidelity. this gets beaten into a pulp.<br /><br />what about some sophistication? think of french films where adultery is the norm. and Mormons with their multiple wives. when will America grow up?<br /><br />and of course as in all American films, in the end the loser-guy reforms, comes around, and conforms to the female ethos. it's a wonder the poor slob, and a doctor to boot!, isn't impotent after going through all the shame, the shame, the shame.<br /><br />a good antidote to this weepy feely goody film might be Casanova, but i haven't seen it yet!\",\n",
       " b\"Based on a Ruth Rendell novel, this is the tale of a young English girl called Eunice who goes to America to be the maid of a rich family. On the surface she seems to be the perfect worker and an excellent cook, but underneath festers years of resentment at being mocked because she can't read. She also has strange visions with lots of blood, and has a surprisingly quick temper.. a fact that her father has already found out to his cost. Her only friend after relocating to the States is a religious nut who used to be a prostitute, and thanks to her influence, Eunice is slowly pushed over the edge..<br /><br />This is a rather dull psychological thriller which finally comes to life ten minutes before the end. Of course, by then it's too little too late. Rita Tushingham does a marvellous job in making Eunice a believable character with her solitary ways and slow decline into insanity. However, the screenplay doesn't give her enough to do other than hide in cupboards and peek round doors while listening to secret conversations. There is also a tedious half brother/sister relationship that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, and a cute dog that always turns up where it's least wanted. This sort of thing was done better in the 90's on ITV when Rendell's books were divided into 120 minute episodes. Here it looks like they've had a bigger budget, but to the script and film's detriment. I give it a 3/10\",\n",
       " b'This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only \"villian\" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.<br /><br />This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.']"

       "[b'If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10, this would be it. \\'House of the Dead\\' redefines the term \"bad movie\". Other bad movies, such as \\'When A Stranger Calls\\' or \\'Premonition\\', will actually look much better when compared to \\'House of the Dead\\'. The basic \"plot\" of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the \"rave of the century\". When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl\\'s chest and to include the hilarious line, \"it smells like someone farted out here.\" The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It\\'s like they don\\'t even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.  The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll\\'s camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It\\'s like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la \\'The Matrix\\'. Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious \\'House of the Dead\\'.  \\'House of the Dead\\' isn\\'t bad because it\\'s based on a video game. In fact, it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of \\'so bad that it\\'s good\\'. It does however fit into the category of \\'so bad that it\\'s painful\\'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you didn\\'t make \\'House of the Dead\\' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make \\'House of the Dead\\' sound funny, it really isn\\'t. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs.',\n",
       " b'The worst part of this movie is how talented the cast is in everything else they\\'ve appeared in. In this, they are smug, self righteous and annoying. The main problem is, that they are trying to act like \"normal people\" and some of the most talented actors, just can\\'t pull that off. Philip Seymour Hoffman can definitely pull it off. Paul Giamatti can pull it off. These actors appear uncomfortable and really boring trying to be \"regular\" people in unusual situations, but even the situations are not that usual. The minority of people watching movies are actors or authors or whatever, so these situations don\\'t ring true and as the most annoying of all, Maggie Gyllenhall comes across as giggly and stupid, something that is sad to watch, given how talented she is. Trust THIS woman, do NOT watch this movie!!!',\n",
       " b\"I love this movie! I've seen it about four times, and every time I see it, Ramon Novarro gets cuter and cuter. He portrays the lazy and carefree islander to perfection, and Renee Adoree's performance is as heartbreaking as that in THE BIG PARADE. As a big fan of Donald Crisp, and used to his roles as kindly father figures, the lech he portrays in this film is a bit jarring, but he does an admirable job, considering he was really a big-hearted marshmallow. One of the greatest films in the twilight of the silent era.\",\n",
       " b'I have always been a huge James Bond fanatic! I have seen almost all of the films except for Die Another Day, and The World Is Not Enough. The graphic\\'s for Everything Or Nothing are breathtaking! The voice talents......... WOW! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN! He is finally Bond in a video game! HE IS BOND! I enjoyed the past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire. This one is definitely the best! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (may I call him Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes I can!) He was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game....... AT LONG LAST! DUH! I\\'ve seen him perform with Robin Williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( I mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor\\'s who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: \"Pierce Brosnan, thank you for being James Bond,\" \"If it wasn\\'t for you, I wouldn\\'t know who James Bond is.\" He\\'s a great actor! I am a huge fan of Willem Dafoe even though I\\'ve seen him in a couple of movies. His role as Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant. (Did I spell the character\\'s name right?) LOL!!!! He does a great job with an accent. Sometimes I can\\'t even hear an accent. I have seen Willem, I mean Mr. Dafoe, perform in two movies: Finding Nemo, and Spider-Man with my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! Anyway, He never ceases to amaze. And Richard Kiel, wow, he\\'s definitely got the part of Jaw\\'s nailed. I\\'ve seen him in the movie\\'s and he\\'s awesome! As a matter of fact, my Grandparent\\'s have met Mr. Kiel, and I was jealous when they told me. But, Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebritie\\'s that I want to meet. John Cleese was breathtaking. I have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating Q! Mr. Cleese was hilarious! I\\'ve seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. He\\'s awesome! John Cleese\\'s most recent project is Shrek 2 starring Mike Myer\\'s, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew\\'s and Eddie Murphy. ( Shrek 2 is now in theatre\\'s!) GOOD LUCK 007! Oh, yeah, and as Q alway\\'s says: \"Grow up 007!\"',\n",
       " b'Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie... Carrie Ann Moss as \"Mom\"?, even better. Zombie girlfriends?   \"...My father thied to eat me... I never tried to eat Timmy.\"   And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It\\'s kinda like Airplane meets (meats?) Night of the Living Dead, sponsored by Zomcom..  And don\\'t forget my head coffin  And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just way cool!  And yes, the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on.   Sufice it to say, it all really works!',\n",
       " b'Well it\\'s not Gone with the Wind, that\\'s for sure! This movie features a woman with one change of underwear who apparently never leaves her apartment, and a bloke who looks better in a wedding dress than I ever did. Plus a mystic cab driver with nothing better to do than hang around waiting for them. And they don\\'t eat in three days.  But leaving aside the practicalities, I enjoyed it immensely, although I\\'m not sure I can define why. My teen age kids bought me this DVD for Mother\\'s Day - or to be more exact, I bought it and instructed my kids to give it to me. My motives are probably too murky to discuss here.   But having only seen David Wenham previously as Faramir in The Lord of the Rings, in drag as Audrey in Moulin Rouge and as the dubious Carl in Van Helsing ( a movie of quite excruciating badness), it was rather disconcerting to hear his real accent. I mean I knew in theory that Wenham was Australian, but hearing him sound quite so much like Richie Benaud, the cricket commentator whose dulcet tones take me straight back to childhood and my late father\\'s obsession with the thud of leather on willow, was almost more than I could handle.  But I\\'m digressing. The movie. Lots of fun sex, which is always a good thing if well done, and this is pretty well done, especially towards the end of the movie as the couple really get into each other, lots of comments on men and women, (if a little clich\\xc3\\xa9d), and a happy ending, and it never takes itself too seriously. It is a little heavy handed in places - I\\'m thinking here of the close ups of the women\\'s mouths prior to the blow job in bath scene. Not subtle. Not a great work of art, but mildly erotic, entertaining and quite funny.   And when evaluating their various past relationships, the script never plunges into the kind of overwrought pathos that would be obligatory in Hollywood. When Cin discovers the photo in Josh\\'s wallet, I was horribly afraid we\\'d get an explanation of the \"love of my life killed in a tragic auto wreck\" variety. Instead we get a quite refreshing \"she messed me about so I moved to London\" line. Real life, for all that it\\'s mundane.  David Wenham does \"bemused everyman\" to perfection as Josh, and is obviously an actor of huge range. Susie Porter (who is gorgeous) is both vulnerable and tough where necessary as Cin. They look like real people, and seem just as dim-witted as the rest of us. I shall watch it again.',\n",
       " b'This film was not scary or creepy. It was a pathetic version of \"chuckie\", yet shorter. If you are looking for a decent horror movie, your not in the right area.It was an alright episode, but not if your looking for scary. It was unrealistic, more supernatural. Also quite bad acting if i must say. I would recommend, \\'The haunting in Kenetticut\\'. Its scary, mind-controlling. It is far more advanced then this excuse of a horror. I watched it with a group of friend, you\\'ll be looking round corners, closing curtains and leaving lights on. I leaves you with nightmares. I really think you should consider this as an alternative.',\n",
       " b\"Michael and Mark Polish have created a truly heartwarming film. I sat glued to the TV as I watched this video. My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world. Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.  Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.  Michele Hicks, her performance was awesome. She portrayed a true friend to both Blake and Frances, and a beautiful lover to Blake.  Lesley Ann Warren - what can I say - you were magnificent. Your performance as the mother who was haunted by giving up her children was heartbreaking. Making amends is not always easy and in the case of your character, a very difficult scene to act.  To the rest of the cast - I don't have enough room to write - you were all great!  I give this movie a 10. It deserves more, but that's the highest I can vote.  Thank you Michael and Mark Polish and all of the other actors, actresses, producers, directors, special effects, make-up artists, musicians, etc. that created one of the centuries best films.  \",\n",
       " b'This was really one of my favorite films...serious and well-acted, particularly by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, taking nothing from the other fine actors in the cast. If I have any criticism at all, it would be that it should have been better edited. The last \"flashback\" scene in the film could have been eliminated and a good portion of the the train station scene when Earp looks for those who killed Morgan and injured Virgil. But then, that is the Director\\'s call and Kasdan couldn\\'t seem to let the project go. Costner was superb.',\n",
       " b'This film is, in short, a cinematic masterpiece. The film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life has wrought on each of them. One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.  This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving. The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film. This is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience.',\n",
       " b\"This one features all the (bad) effect of Prior's cheap-o movies, but is so overtly racist, nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature. Unless you plan to enlist in the Marines, skip this one. Oh, and even if you do, avoid it at all costs.\",\n",
       " b\"Most of this film shows the late Jeffrey Strouth, in the back seat of a car, talking and talking and talking and talking about his many unusual experiences. Either he has a huge, exaggeration-inflated imagination, or, he's one of those folks who is extremely often effected by planned and co-incidental timing, resulting in his involvement in a plethora of rare occurrences. In any event, I don't dispute the interestingness of his tales. But I sure did get tired of his banter: a style which others have characterized as queenish and effeminate. Sorry if I'm dwelling too much on delivery and not enough on substance. I'm not bothered by fingernails screeching on a chalkboard; but Jeffrey's rambling really turned me off - to the extent that I was unable to fully concentrate on the dialogue. Therefore, it's MY expectation that, in this case, the book must certainly be better than the movie.\",\n",
       " b\"I hate to bash anyone's work, but this is simply the WORST film ever. It would take far too long to list this film's problems, but suffice to say...you will be wasting your time and money on a terrible film.  As far as the mother's killing their babies because of La Lorona, well that could have been handled in a terrifying but effective way (if it had to be handled), but this is not a thoughtful or sensitive treatment. It's not even a scary horror movie and the acting is so stiff - where was the director?  As to why it was shot in New York City instead of Mexico, clearly there were budget issues. But location is the least of the problems. I wish there was something good to say about this film, but I couldn't find it.  Maybe the film's writer/director or some cast/crew can post some positive comments...\",\n",
       " b'Well, basically, the movie blows! It\\'s Blair Witch meets Sean Penn\\'s ill conceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the \"War on Terror\" is really about. The script sounds like it was written by 8th grader (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things--but it just didn\\'t look like real documentaries I\\'ve watched), and worst of all Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd. I\\'d rather watch the Blair Witch VIII, than sit through that again.',\n",
       " b'Reading some of the reviews here reminds of some critic reviews of various children\\'s movies, wherein they complain about childish plots, low humor or movies that didn\\'t hold their attention, forgetting that they are, in fact, reviewing a children\\'s movie.  This movie falls into similar areas, although it\\'s clearly not a children\\'s movie. It is meant to be a spoof, a parody, and it pokes fun at all kinds of people, be they Asian, Caucasian, African-American, Italian, or what have you. It\\'s not meant to be an Oscar candidate. It\\'s meant to be plain silly, slapstick fun. And in that regard, it\\'s perfect.  No, Yune looks nothing like Bruce Lee. No, he\\'s not even Chinese. But therein lies the humor. It\\'s as much a send-up of Western stereotypes of Asians as anything (ever watch the \"Average Asian\" skits on MadTV with another Korean, Bobby Lee?).  Overall, I have loved this movie every time I\\'ve seen it (although the sequel isn\\'t quite the classic), and I would rate it as a fall - out - of - my - seat - and - wet - myself type of comedy. You just have to let your mind go and enjoy it for what it is. Pure, silly, goofball slapstick... :)',\n",
       " b\"Here's my disclaimer: I am related to someone involved in the film, so I'm not completely unbiased. Having said that, I saw the preview at Sundance and I thought it was a great movie. The beginning really conveys a sense of how painfully disconnected and lacking direction Dave Tibble (Trevor Morgan) is. As the film progresses Ray Cook (Nick Nolte), in contrast to Dave's father (Timothy Hutton), shows Dave that whether or not you are completely successful the only way to really live life is to engage with its issues, without self-pity. The cast was all excellent, especially Nick Nolte; he was awesome in in this role. The conclusion of the film is bittersweet yet hopeful.\",\n",
       " b'Ben and Katie Jordan (played by Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfieffer) are in love...well, they WERE in love! After fifteen years of marriage and two children, the love is fading fast, and divorce seems like the only light bright light they see. While their children, Erin (Colleen Rennison) and Josh (Jake Sandvig) are away at summer camp, Ben and Katie tell about the highs and lows of their fifteen year marriage, and remember both the good times which seem to bring them closer again and the bad times, which totally tear them apart...again. Yet beyond the heated arguments between Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, there are Ben and Katie\\'s strong, passionate feelings for each other...which could possibly bring hope in saving their marriage.  \"The Story of Us\" is a sappy love story for just about anyone! Okay, it\\'s not the BEST or most brilliant movies I ever seen, but perhaps, this film can teach valuable lessons of what true love is and of course that sometimes the bad times in a relationship of any kind can bring partners closer together...especially if they\\'ve been married for fifteen years!!! :)   What I liked about this film was the moments of bubbly humour in which some of the characters brought on-screen (i.e. the ever annoying Andy and Joanie Kirby played by Bill Kirchenbauer and Lucy Webb during the \"I HATE THE KIRBY\\'S\" part of the movie), and the senseless fights between Ben and Katie. One thing\\'s for sure, you can easily see the guilt in their eyes after they fight! Yet that\\'s kind of cute! Though it\\'s obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!  They kind of remind of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo from \"I Love Lucy\" only they are living in a different decade...they have more children...and they curse more (well...duh)! Yet like Ricky and Lucy, they seem to fight over stupid things, which is normal in any relationship, right? But of course...some of the issues they did fight over were kind of serious and maybe important to them personally. From Ben\\'s complaints about Dot (Katie\\'s mother) to Katie\\'s complaints about \"the other woman\" in which her husband denies. Kind of serious stuff...huh?  Let\\'s put it this way: \"The Story of Us\" is a modern American love story with a heartwarming twist that you cannot ignore! Anyone would enjoy this movie...especially women and romance lovers! If you like novels by Danielle Steel or Sandra Brown or enjoyed films such as \"You\\'ve Got Mail\", \"Nine Months\", or \"Down To You\", you will like \"The Story of Us\"! Or...  If you\\'re in for a good romance film in which you laugh or cry to or could sit back and relax, rent this movie! I\\'m not into these sappy, simple love stories some films have to offer, but I enjoyed this movie!!!...and you NEVER KNOW...maybe YOU will like it too!!! :)',\n",
       " b\"OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.  I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.  The editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.  Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.  This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all cost!\",\n",
       " b\"Although it is hated by most long time FF fans, I find 8 to be one of my favorites. With incredible graphics (the characters are a far cry from the blockyness of 7) and a new magic system, 8 also has an intreguing storyline that follows young squall around the world. Plus, the gunblade weapon is one of the coolest new weapons around, and the new limit break system makes for cool divergences from normally routine battle (if you have ever seen Squall's 'Lionhearted' limit break you know what im talking about.) Plus, it has truly the hardest enemy I have ever fought, the Omega Weapon, much harder than the final boss to say the least. Over all, it's a great game, and out of the whole series, it ranks number 2 in my book.\",\n",
       " b\".............this is nothing compared with the book of the same name. Occasionally you'll get movie/ miniseries conversions that are better than the book (Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, Misery, Stand By Me), some that are different to the book but ultimately on a par (Christine) but from the ones I've seen so far, more often than not they get completely lost in translation; this is a classic example. It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story. If you want to be entertained, I'd suggest going for the above title or maybe 'Storm of the Century'.\",\n",
       " b'This starts out with an alien spaceship being found during the blizt , a homage to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT no doubt but as the series progresses it comes more as an insult than a homage. I rate Nigel Kneale as television`s greatest ever writer and QUATERMASS AND THE PIT as the greatest drama ever to have been transmitted under the telefantasy banner and to have INVASION EARTH pay homage in this way is an obscenity . INVASION EARTH is possibly the worst telefantasy series ever made by the BBC . It is truly awful  The script is responsible , the opening episode features so many coincidences in order to bring the characters together it looses all credibility , but after the first episode it gets worse , concepts like the NDs ( They`re the bad guys from another dimension I think ) polluting the water supply and kidnapping humans in order to carry out experiments on them are underdeveloped and badly explained while entire episodes are padded out with the subplot of a Second world war army officer`s journey through the galaxy with a race of good aliens . All this is unnecessary to the plot , at least I think it is because I`m not sure what the plot is , describing the plot of INVASION EARTH is like describing the plot of a James Bond film , lots of things happen but none of it adds up to much. In which case I`ll say in INVASION EARTH not much happens and none of it makes much sense. Truly awful',\n",
       " b\"A young girls turning 18 and discovering her womanhood. Her older sister, willing to sacrifice her life in order to get her family out of poverty. Their father, an ill-tempered and drunken author with a severe case of writer's block. Their stepmother whose livelihood depends on closeness with an artist. One dashing American who can marry one sister and take the whole family out of its plight. The American's brother, who doesn't necessarily agree with his sibling's choice. Set the story in England in the 1930's and you've pretty much woven the tapestry for this lovely tale of poverty, hope, dreams and love.  Cassandra, convincingly played by Romola Garai, is the pillar of this poor English family. A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back. During this maddening wait, Cassandra writes her most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary and brings us along the roller-coaster ride that is the passage from childhood to womanhood.  The movie takes place in rural England, in an old castle. The camera work is fabulous. Blazing sunshine in good times and rain and clouds as life becomes more of a burden. The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.  I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel, but I've yet to see a movie adaptation that was better than the book. By these standards, the novel must be a formidable read.  I don't know what it is with English films. Being in North America, I've always heard that the English have a stiff upper lip and that they don't show any emotions. Yet, some of the most touching films and love stories I've seen were English (Sense and Sensibility comes to mind, here -- OK, Ang Lee isn't technically English but the screenplay and novel were; that's close enough in my book).  If you like funny, emotional and touching stories, without the loud music, the fake emotions and the telegraphed ending, you will enjoy this film immensely.\",\n",

       " b'The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.  One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. It doesn\\'t look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often Also, the characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of \"Moby Dick.\" When the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong.   Overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years.',\n",
       " b'Well, I\\'ll start by admitting I\\'m not a John Ford fan. (I watched \"The Informer\" only because I\\'m trying to work my way through a list of the \"greats.\") So if you are, just move along, \\'cause you\\'re not going to agree with me.  What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. I suppose it\\'s somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the \"talkies\" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) What dialogue there is usually has a \"They\\'re always after me Lucky Charms!\" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we\\'re in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.)  Techniques change. Tastes change. So I won\\'t go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. But it\\'s not one of the classics that hold up --- more just \"fair warning\" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career.',\n",

Both characters create a very intriguing slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in Mulholland Dr.  Beautiful. For Lynch fan\\'s.  ',\n",
       " b\"I found it very interesting that almost only Hungarian people wrote reviews on this film.  About the film: IMO this is a typical French comedy, with lots of embarrassing and silly but funny situations and decent acting. Belmondo is in top form, the ladies are OK. If you like French comedies this is right up your street.  What makes this movie unforgettable for many of my fellow citizens is the extremely high quality of the Hungarian dubbing. I mean, I watched this film with the original sound and i have to tell you I didn't get half of the pleasure than watching it with the Hungarian voices.( In Hungary films on TV are usually dubbed and the standard of voice acting in the country was top notch for years. It's slowly declining nowadays, though, I'm afraid.)Many Hungarians know the entire script by heart and it's always a good party thing if you quote a line from this film. To us it's just fun.  Like I said earlier this might not be your cup of tea. However, just for the laughs you can watch it on a day when there's not much to do(I wish I had more of them). It's impossible not to -at least- smiley on the lovely character played by Belmondo.\",\n",
       " b\"As romantic comedies go, this was a cute and winning one. I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point. But, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. I hope to see them cast in more projects soon.  Overall, this movie won't change your life, but is is sweet, warm and winning. Not a bad thing to be at all.\",\n",
       " b\"This film opened in this country recently, right after another prison massacre in Brazil, where inmates were killed after they rioted.  Hector Babenco's film is a sad commentary on society's failure to turn these criminals in jail, into law abiding citizens. If anything, this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison.  Add to that the horrible conditions of jails in certain parts of the world. Any would be criminal should think twice about the consequence of their actions. Landing in a penal institution is a hellish experience, at best. How can lawmakers of the world think that a criminal mind will be changed by sending them to places such as Carandiru? If anything, placing these criminals with other criminals in such conditions will perpetuate crime and if the prisoner survives the term, he will be scarred for life.  Not having read the book in which this film is based, it is only fair to say that Mr. Babenco, an excellent director, has given us a realistic film about what hell must be like.\",\n",
       " b\"I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple.   The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Even the little moments just melt your heart.   This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. A masterpiece.\",\n",
       " b\"Hausu is a horror comedy which depicts the subtle art of Japanese film-making. The scare factor here does not lie on the visuals, but more on the emotions of the characters, Oshare, the teenage girl who lost her Mom and eventually reunited with her father during her vacation. Her bliss faded when her father introduced her to her stepmother. That disappointing fact made her change to be sullen, and started writing letters to her aunt, and that was the start of her journey with her bunch of friends to the mysterious house.  The loss of a loved one, being in solitude, hoping for broken promises are the every person's fears that are hard to recognize. Amidst the funny visuals and average effects,(what can we expect from the technology in 1970s and movie-making is not that much better as we have it now) the movie wants to impart these things and I believe this what makes this film worth seeing and truly a classic.\",\n",
       " b\"This one works on several levels, that may not all be apparent to the casual viewer. It delves into the sci-fi area of the fear and apprehension of the new and strange unfamiliar technologies that did, do and always will cause mankind to shudder to think of just what our role will be in the future. This parallels the then current political idea of a society that would be best ruled by scientists, engineers and the like. Known as 'TECHNOCRACY', this system neither had much room nor any sympathy for the human side of things, too inefficient.  Secondly, the inclusion of the Satanist cult is both a throw back to old Gothic type horror tales of witches, ghosts and the supernatural. This is a link to the vampire and werewolf, and is a horror that cannot be more universal (not Universal!). Fear of the occult.  Thirdly, the element of the story that is perhaps the most pertinent to our 'modern' world. The Mansion,which serves as the setting for most of the film, is built on the sight of a great World War I battle, in which countless thousands lost their lives. This in the end is probably the most horrifying (and truthful) element. When combined with the blood-letting and cruelties of man to fellow man that are portrayed as the climax to the film, the movie sounds both a condemnation of what has transpired in the previous part of the 20th century, WWI, and the unthinkable atrocities that were to come.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a story of a girls quest to become a Musketeer like her father D'Artagnan. It's very entertaining and suitable for the whole family.  We all like Susie Amy who plays Valentine D'Artagnan, very much. Thought all the young musketeers were great and it was a lovely contrast with the older characters, their fathers. I am a big Michael York fan so it was good to see him back as D'Artagnan.  It could be a bit storytelling at times, but that is needed for younger viewers. The fight sequences could be slightly repetitive and many of the action movies are, but they were well done.  Think from reading other information, this wasn't filmed as a movie but as a TV mini series so it is quite long to watch in one sitting.  But all in all, what you'd expect, not difficult to follow but entertaining viewing for the family.\",\n",
       " b\"Tarantino and Rodriguez are two of my favourite directors but this film still left me cold. Maybe it was because I was expecting so much. When I was told about the film it sounded great -four rooms, four directors- two of which I loved. But sadly as is always the case when you expect something brilliant you rarely feel satisfied, and for me this was an extremely unsatisfying film.  Out of the whole cast there were only 3 characters I liked - the 2 kids in The Misbehaviors and Marisa Tomei. For me the rest were at best boring and at worst irritating to the point of actual anger. I really like Tim Roth, normally, but his character actually made me angry, he was so irritating and slapstick that I wanted him to get killed in some horrendous way, something I never wish for the protagonist of a film. Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.  This is just my opinion and is of course subject to change as maybe if I watched it again at the right time and in the right mood I may see something I missed and get what all the people who enjoyed the movie got. I don't think I could take the risk though.\",\n",

Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch.  The acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high-school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less.  After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad.',\n",

Great recommendations from Myself to Watch or Buy this Film.  I collect horror Movies and Soundtracks, So listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot.  There is only one thing that do not fascinate Me, the endings.  According to Prophecy it is all inaccurate, Including Final conflict, and Left behind.  But My conclusion being....

I want to go and see it again. I may or may not do that. I realise that the reason I want to see it again is that it inspires a deep yearning in me for depth and beauty and purity and truth and love.

       " b'(There are Spoilers) Being told by his doctor that he hasn\\'t got long to live meek and kindly bookkeeper Otto Kringelein, Lionel Barrymore, decides to go out in grand fashion. Taking his life\\'s savings with him, some 11,000 Marks, Otto is to spends his last days on earth in the most expensive hotel in Berlin the aptly named \"Grand Hotel\".  It\\'s at the Grand Hotel Otto gets to meet his abusive boss, at the textile factory, Preysing, Wallace Beery, who treats him with total destine. Preysing is certain that the only way Otto can afford to stay at that swanky and expensive joint is that he embezzled his business. Otto gets his by now hot in the collar boss even madder at him by stealing his pretty stenographer Flaemmchen or Flaem for short, Joan Crawford, who sees what a creep her, like Otto\\'s, boss the Iron Prussian-like Preysing really is.  The movie \"Grand Hotel\" also has as one of its guests the flat broke and compulsive gambler Baron Felix Von Geigern, John Barrymore. Baron Felix lost his entire fortune playing baccarat and is now in danger of getting his legs broken if he doesn\\'t come up with the cash, 5,000 Marks, that he owes the \"Boys\" who\\'ve been backing up his losing bets. Baron Felix now on his last legs which he\\'ll need crutches for if the \"Boys\" don\\'t get their money is planning to rob the Great Grusinskaya, Greta Garbo, the worlds greatest ballerina who\\'s also a guest at the hotel.

Baron Felix who\\'s only friend on earth up to that time is his cute and faithful Dachshund Adolphus, or Adolph for short, will later \"make it\" with that cold fish of a woman Grusinskaya while in the process of burglarizing her hotel suite! Catching Baron Felix off guard, by coming back to her suite early, Grusinskya is charmed by the handsome rogue who sweet talks her right out of her dance costume and into her bed; With him joining it.  It\\'s later that the Baron after confessing his love for Grusinskaya, and returning her stolen pearl necklace, decides to use the naive Otto in a card game of baccarat he set up. This is done by Baron Felix in order to get back the money he owes the \"Boys\" before the \"Boys\" who\\'ve just about had it with him, in his stalling to pay them back their money, end up making him a cripple. The card game goes good for first-time gambler, beginners luck?, Otto who breaks the bank walking away with another, to his already 11,0000, 3,500 Marks.  With time running out on him in paying the \"Boys\" back their money a desperate Baron Felix grabs Otto\\'s, who\\'s dead drunk for drinking champaign, wallet with some 15,000 Marks for him to finally pay back the \"Boys\" before they pay him, in working the Baron over, back with compounded interest and fractures. ***SPOILERS***It\\'s then that Baron Felix finally sees the light and gives up his life of a cat burglar and con-artist but only after one last fling, in robbing Preysing room, which turned out to be fatal for him.  Despite the major and established stars in the film, Greta Garbo the Barrymores and Wallace Beery, it was Joan Crawford, compared to the quality of acting talent she was up against, in a more or less supporting role who stole the films acting honors. Being both wholesome and sensuous Miss. Crawford was able to put the grubby and aggressive Preysing in his place. This was by showing him that the person whom he held in contempt, and was a rival for her affections, the sweet and soft speaking Otto was a bigger success, as a human being, that he\\'ll ever be.   In the end the so sure of himself Preysing ended up being lead out of the Grand Hotel in handcuffs and going to jail for crimes committed by him on and off the premises. As for the meek and sensitive Otto, whom Preysing stepped on for some 30 years, he also left with Flaem for Paris to spend his last, and extremely happy, days with her at that city\\'s \"Grand Hotel\".',\n",
       " b\"High heels are tricksy things. They can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.  Almod\\xc3\\xb3var's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. The best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.  There's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from Almod\\xc3\\xb3var, but otherwise Tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. Instead it's poor. High Heels stumbles for sure.\",\n",

My favorite one is the one where Elyse\\'s (Meredith Baxter Birney) brother, Ned (Tom Hanks), comes to town. You\\'ll have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how any why. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. I also loved the theme song. It\\'s called \"Without Us,\" and it\\'s performed by Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams. Before I wrap this up, I hope that all you die-hard fans of the show will always have it live on in syndication.

       " b'Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders.   The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, \"George Grisby,\" is one of the strangest people I\\'ve ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone isn\\'t far behind in the \"strange\" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles\\' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says.   Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints.   This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.',\n",
       " b'Adrian went all out for this lavish, gorgeous production of \"Marie Antoinette\" starring Norma Shearer, who is never more beautiful or glamorous than in this epic biography. This Marie is quite the heroine, a woman of the people, generous to a fault, and never says, \"Let them eat cake,\" and would only have said it in reference to her children. History tells us that Marie\\'s downfall was really the \"Affair of the Necklace,\" and she was no different from other aristocrats in being totally out of touch with what was going on with the French people.  This film is jaw dropping in its splendor. Adrian\\'s costumes are totally magnificent, as are the palace settings. Tyrone Power is drop-dead gorgeous as Marie\\'s Swedish lover, who comes to her aid in her time of need. Power was the inspiration for Barbara Cartland to say, when asked how she could write so convincingly about sex while she was a still a virgin, \"We didn\\'t need sex. We had Tyrone Power.\" The rest of the cast is fantastic, including Robert Morley, John Barrymore, Joseph Schildkraut, and Gladys George. As for Norma, she does a great job, giving a vivid, if movie star, performance in one of her last films. The last scenes are very touching and beautifully done.  I had no expectations for this film and as a rule am not crazy about period pieces, but this one swept me away. It does follow history quite closely - for those who commented that the Tyrone Power character was fictional, he was not, and he did try to help her.  Don\\'t miss this one.  **A funny Marie Antionette anecdote: The studio wanted Shearer to use their contract star, Robert Taylor, but Shearer got a look at Power at a dinner, invited him to be part of the film, and got her way. During their first kiss, she held on so long the kiss had to be edited down. Power apparently did not return her affections. She became angry. At a photo shoot, she appeared with gigantic plumes that hid him as he posed behind her and the plumes shot up. The photographer gave Power a box to stand on. As the photographer activated the flash, Power crashed through the box and hit the floor. Though he escorted Shearer to the premier, he snuck out to see his soon to be wife, Annabella.',\n",

But, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the Nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter. Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths. But enough of that.. domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones. Oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.  In fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they'd signed up for and gone AWOL. Yes, I know it's hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you'd want. If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting. Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress Rosalie Cole (The next Dakota Fanning she ain't) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.  This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on. But back up a minute.. earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it. So do they stay where they are safe? No of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown.  Finally, the film closes. It doesn't end, it just goes to a grinding halt. The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened. But, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened. You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you're ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Just think.. years from now on your deathbed, what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family. Sadly, it's already too late for me. Don't you make the same mistake :( 2/10\",\n",

While the film has a man shot in the airport for crimes that a never specified this film seems to be a starting point for Hollywood's fixation with tin pot Latin American dictators/despots. In this film the bad guys are the supporters of Battista and the law abiding guys are working for the Castro Government. The only thing missing is a rally for Che. Not a very good film the acting is surprisingly wooden. I had a lot of good memories of Cameron Mitchell but this film made me question my recollections. The film was obviously shot on sets and very little location work is done. The dialog is uninspiring, and unlike other films of this era this film is not much fun to watch.\",\n",

At least, that's what Sheriff Lyndon Harris finds when he spots a truck full of the insects crash. He must try to warn the people of his town before a Honey Festival (a really lame excuse to attract the bees) takes place.  Even the '70s thriller 'The Swarm' had better special effects than this, probably because the makers didn't automatically switch to a digital solution every time a stunt was involved.  All in all, the acting is terrible, the plot is awful and the best special effect in the whole movie is the farmer's decomposing body after he swallows a bee in his beer.\",\n",

But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that I didn't like it very much.  You can make a few laughs. And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.  I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. But it could be much better.\",\n",
       " b'Isabel Allende\\'s magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive Latin mellifluousness of Allende\\'s characters, and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make certain I had not missed something vital that might change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed a thing. None among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director Bille August. All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, by putting forth as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets. (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of its life.) Curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before KFC came into being. Back then, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardoning that, what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. \"The House of the Spirits\" should have been the motion picture event of 1993. Because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have pressed charges for rape.',\n",
       " b'A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film?  In fact, what is the point of it?  The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline.  The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable.  Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? I guess we have to wait for the sequel.  ',\n",

There should be no comparisons between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny. Class Reunion is neither of those things. The sad thing is it had such potential (good cast, good story lines) but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl...NOT FUNNY. The only funny character were Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil).  National Lampoon has made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation) but this isn't one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.\",\n",

Why does everything look so weathered in an underground bunker?), one major flaw sticks out at me (!MAJOR SPOILER HERE STOP!) as the three are escaping, they exit VIA this kind of log ride DOWN several tall chutes... yet somehow they emerge several hundred meters above the city and are able to look directly down on it.

       " b'I went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack-and-slash films rampant on the screen these days. Boy, was I surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber, dark atmosphere. More surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As with most good movies, this one leaves something to the imagination, and Bill Paxton did a superb job at directing. Scenes shot inside the car as are well done and, after watching the \"Anatomy of a Scene\" episode at the end of the video tape, It was good to see that some of the subtle, yet wonderful things I had noticed were intentional and not just an \"Oh, that looks good, keep it\" type of direction. This is a moody movie, filled with grimness. Still, for the dark subject, a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (Okay, I\\'ve always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never goes over the top. Au Contraire, it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film. If there is any one area where this film lacks, it is in the ending, which seems just a bit too contrived, but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie. What is the message? It\\'s something that each individual decides for themself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre (ie: \"Body Heat\" or \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\"), and about a 5 for those who don\\'t.',\n",

       " b\"When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.  So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat. A disparate group of passengers and crew are torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and wind up together in a lifeboat. After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them. The last one picked up on board is a German.  The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.  Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.  The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.  Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.  The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.  And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic.\",\n",

If you like Neil Simon's comedic plays and films, then this is the one to place on your 'must see' list. Actors Lemmon and Dennis each do an impeccably hilarious job. Lemmon, again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and Dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. Neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this.  On the Remake: Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn reprised the Kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable Simon original script.   There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to.   Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.\",\n",
       " b'What always impresses me about Zhang Yimou\\'s *Shanghai Triad* is how the two settings of the film -- the Thirties-era, glitzy nightclub milieu of the gangsters in Shanghai and the pastoral scene in the second half -- are used as a counterpoint to the drama unfolding before us. The settings are glamorous, mythical, beautiful; the people are not.  The characters are, in fact, brutally ordinary. Even the ostensible hero of the piece, the 14-year-old boy who becomes the servant of chanteuse Gong Li, is not particularly remarkable: not intuitive, not very smart, and certainly not a winner. Ineffectual to the end, he ends up suspended upside-down like the famed Hanged Man in a deck of Tarot. The plot involving the Thirties-era Shanghai Mafia is mostly presented through the boys\\' eyes, with the result that the most \"action-oriented\" events, usually occurring off-screen, seem incoherent and, though violent and tragic, beside the point. The Boss\\'s girlfriend Gong Li obsesses us to the same degree that she devours the boy. All else -- meaning, the plot\\'s wider macrocosm -- remains tangential or dangerously opaque. It turns out that there is plenty enough drama in the day-to-day life of the gangster\\'s moll, played by Gong Li with a seemingly infinite variety: shallow, slutty, heartbroken, tragic, pathetic, whimsical, tender. The poor boy is in a dither. One minute he hates her enough to spit in her tea when her back is turned; the next he smiles at her childish singing like the first fool in love in the history of the world. (By the way, let it be said that I would\\'ve had my left ear cut off if given the chance to be Li\\'s boy-servant!)  \"Miss Bijou\" could almost have become a real human being if permitted just a few more weeks on the island. The snotty poisons appear to ooze away from her; the rustic setting puts her back in touch with a girlish freedom, almost forgotten (and hardly suspected by us). In several of Shakespeare\\'s plays, there exists what his critics call a \"green world\" -- a haven far away from the corruptions of urban life. Zhang permits us brief glimpses of decency that are engendered by this potentially healing \"green world\", all under the nose of the ruthless crime lord (who is ostensibly there to heal from his knife wound, as well). These glimpses are so powerfully touching that we tend to forget the Boss\\'s evil eminence, and therefore the machinations of the gangsters -- never forgotten by THEM, of course -- intermittently slap us awake.  All of which is another way of saying that Yue Lu\\'s cinematography is almost too astonishing for the movie\\'s subject. *Shanghai Triad* is, without question, one of the most beautiful-looking movies of the Nineties, perhaps of all time. But don\\'t let the beauty of the pictures, or Gong Li\\'s physical charms, for that matter, distract you from the preciseness of Zhang\\'s direction. Obliged to commit to the idea of subjective camera placement (that is, generally taking the perspective of the boy), Zhang evinces great subtlety and restraint. For instance, he uses the Steadicam here, but doesn\\'t get carried away with it in order to create some sort of mood or tone, the way Kubrick was prone to do. Zhang knows when to move the camera, and he knows when to keep the damn thing still: it depends on what each scene calls for. Every frame of this film is directed to a specific aesthetic purpose.  By the way, this movie makes a natural double-bill with Hou Hsiao-Hsien\\'s *Millennium Mambo*, another exercise in exquisite aesthetics with a plot about a gangster\\'s moll. One wonders if Hou wasn\\'t a bit tainted by the influence of *Shanghai Triad*, despite *Mambo*\\'s 21st-century setting. Both films are about inarticulate, helpless satellites in a criminal universe who come to depressing ends. Needless to say, these films could only have been made in China or Taiwan, home to a culture more ruthlessly realistic than our sappy civilization. If remade as an American film, the Boss in *Shanghai Triad* would have developed a sentimental attachment to the kid which would inevitably bring his criminal empire crashing down around his head. Imagine the reverse, and you\\'ll get the idea of how THIS film ends.  All in all, one of the classics of modern Chinese cinema. 9 stars out of 10.',\n",
       " b\"The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself.

It's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile, because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast, you don't get an idea of what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It isn't one of the great all-time classics, but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       " b'I\\'m always suspicious of films with many titles. I invariably find myself musing as to why the film can be found under so many guises. Could it be that the film is absolutely awful, so its makers and distributors have re-named it and re-marketed it again and again in the hope of eventually finding an appreciative audience? This is such a film - a Euro horror zombie flick which has more alternative titles than cast members! The version I saw was entitled \"Beyond The Living Dead\", and most of the cast members were given nondescript pseudonyms on the credits. For instance, hero Stelvio Rosi was billed as Stanley Cooper, and principle female player Dyanik Zurakowska was billed as Vickie Nesbitt. It\\'s not a particularly good film, but to whole-heartedly savage it would be a touch harsh as there are just a few interesting elements which drag it up above \"awful\" to somewhere in the \"slightly-below-average\" category.  Serge Checkhov (Stelvio Rosi) arrives in an East European town (Skopje in Macedonia is hinted at) for the reading of his uncle\\'s will. He soon discovers that he is to inherit his uncle\\'s mansion, much to the annoyance of his cruel and ambitious aunt Nadia (Maria Pia Conte). Something creepy seems to be going on in town at the same time - his cousin is found hanged from a tree in the cemetery; necrophiliac grave-digger Igor (Paul Naschy) starts to act more outlandishly than usual; Aunt Nadia seduces and copulates with young Serge; a doctor residing in the house starts to show off his experiments to reanimate dead animals; and uncle\\'s corpse occasionally goes missing as if it\\'s got up and begun walking of its own accord. Gradually, Serge investigates and uncovers a plot that Baron Frankenstein himself would\\'ve been mighty proud of.  Mainly the film is underwhelming. The solution to the mystery is revealed in a phony, heavy-handed scene which resembles the unmasking of the villain in a Scooby Doo cartoon. Sometimes the characters say and do such dumb things that you want to scream in despair. The performances are generally amateurish, and the film is thin on real terror. However, as I\\'ve indicated already, it escapes total damnation for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Naschy as the necrophiliac grave digger is hilarious and disturbing (at the same time) in all his scenes. Secondly, the location work is quite impressive. Thirdly, there\\'s plenty of needless nudity to please the voyeurs (check out the scene where Zurakowska bares her tits purely for the hell of it.... a free drink for anyone who can justify the need for THAT scene without using the word exploitation!!!) And fourthly, for some reason that I\\'ve never been able to figure out, the preposterous story is actually engrossing in a totally inexplicable way. Beyond The Living Dead - or whatever title you know it by - is undoubtedly a bad film, but at least it\\'s ENTERTAININGLY bad.',\n",
       " b\"You Can't Cheat An Honest Man finds widower W.C. Fields running a second rate circus and trying to stay one step ahead of the law as he's creditors just about every place he goes. His children, John Arledge and Constance Moore attend a really posh Ivy League type school and you sympathize with Fields because you know this why he's probably not paying his bills. One also can speculate what his wife must have put up with back in the day.  Moore on a visit to Dad's show falls for the ventriloquist sideshow performer Edgar Bergen. But Bergen doesn't really get along with Fields or I should say his alter ego Charlie McCarthy doesn't.  The Fields-McCarthy feud was legendary on radio and it might seem hard to fathom how a ventriloquist could entertain on radio. But the characters he created were so powerful and had such a hold on the minds of the public that they were real. Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd were characters in their own right, they almost but not quite gained separate identities away from Edgar Bergen.  Anyway on Bergen's show, Bill Fields was a frequent guest and the repartee between Fields and McCarthy is still classic. Even without knowing that background, today's audience can still enjoy You Can't Cheat an Honest Man because the comedy is eternal.  There's not much of a plot except for Moore loving Bergen, but being ready to marry snobbish James Bush to help her father in his financial troubles. I'm sure you can figure out how that goes, especially when prospect in-laws Thurston Hall and Mary Forbes meet Fields at a little clambake they're throwing.  The circus offers a range of opportunity for some great gags including trying to pry Charlie McCarthy out of an alligator, an elephant who gives Fields showers on command and of course sawing Charlie in half during a magic act.  Still it's the repartee between Fields and Bergen and another of the unforgettable characterizations that Bill Fields brings us which makes You Can't Cheat An Honest Man a comedy classic.\",\n",

Dawn of the Dead was such an entertaining flick, by no means an Oscar Winner but certainly a well thought out display of zombie gore and emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters.. Dawn of the Dead even ended well, paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what's to come for the characters at the end of the movie. Day of the Dead is not that sequel.  Day of the Dead is almost laughably terrible. The acting is shallow and boring at best. Yes, Ving Rhames is in this, but somehow the producers managed to make Ving look amateurish and uncomfortable. Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie.   The zombies look fake and in no way menacing. The editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly, by the end of the movie I was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed. The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.  Don't waste your time. Try again Steve Miner and Jeffrey Reddick.\",\n",

The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless.

What is not really surprising is the combination of ego and insecurity that plague the top contenders in the annual contest. These traits rear their head at any and every competition, regardless of topic or sport. What is surprising is the sportsmanship involved when there is an apparent major scoring error in the semi-finals. Watching the competitors band together against the committee is something not usually seen in the sporting and gaming world. These guys want the competition to be fair ... no cheap wins. I wonder if Pat Reilly or Bobby Knight would feel the same way? As you might expect the traditional nerd factor is at play here and the filmmakers do a nice job of mixing in some pretty faces to balance the picture. Mike Mussina, Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart are all thrown in to show that all walks of life are addicted and not everyone that is addicted looks like the reclusive nerd we all knew in high school. The most fascinating character in what story there is, is the twenty year old hot shot that most think is too young and inexperienced to really compete at the top. Just as interesting though is the way the more traditional powerhouses react to his presence and apparent skill.  There is a nice peak at the collaborative efforts that go into the creation of the puzzle, even though Mr. Shortz leaves little doubt that it is his responsibility ... hate mail and all. Very nice look into a world that most of us give little thought to.',\n",

As a lapsed Catholic, I did not find any LDS propaganda in this film disturbing, and did not make me want to shuck off my dirty-soul to find salvation. Ignore anyone who tried to divert you, it's not there.  This is a story (once you get past the palm trees, waterfalls, and beautiful islanders) about volunteerism and the American spirit.  Revel in it. Grasp it. Live it.\",\n",

A man finally returns from Spain from decades of self-exile during the Franco years, and reunites with an old flame. Could have been good in the hands of a Mike Leigh, but with this script and director it was a snoozefest. Almost nothing happens. For some reason, \"Das Boot,\" which had more drama in any given two minutes of its running time than \"Volver a empezar\" in its entirety, couldn\\'t be nominated and then selected. Huh?   Oscar did it again this year (2005), when it again picked a dull Spanish movie few will ever see out of the best pool I can remember, with \"Der Undergang\" (Downfall), \"Un long dimanche de fian\\xc3\\xa7ailles\" (A Very Long Engagement), and \"Shi mian mai fu\" (\"House of Flying Daggers). No, I do *not* need to see war explosions or airborne cutlery in all my foreign movies, but com\\'n, how elitist can you get?   Note that \"Volver a empezar\" is not readily available on VHS or DVD. The marketplace knew better than Oscar. And if you do find it be warned that, yes, it will kill any enjoyment you have of \"Pachelbel\\'s Canon.\"',\n",

That is why I was not able to enjoy the movie Snatch as I was knowing what is going to happen. I must say that 'Fool n Final' is one of the badly failed copy cat movies. Not that all the copy cat movies fails. We have good examples of Aitraaz, Bheja Fry, and not so bad examples of Murder, Kaante. This movie fails in copying the fun of the original plot for Indian audience.  If you are reading this to decide whether to watch the movie or not, I will suggest you to watch movie Snatch rather. If you can not get Snatch then may be go on and watch this one. But spend as little money as possible. There are few scenes in the movie which are funny, but they the rest are utter garbage. The changed story line doesn't suit the Indian climate. Music is not so good, acting is not up to mark. I wont say anything much about this.  Watch on your risk, or to be safe watch original movie 'Snatch'.\",\n",

       " b'The 1947 mystery-thriller,\"The Two Mrs.Carrolls\"is considered by many critics to be a tepid,unrealistic film and one of Humphrey Bogart\\'s lesser works. This couldn\\'t be more false. The film contains brilliant performances by Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck,a great deal of eerie suspense,and delicious bits of English humor. The plot of the film is similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock\\'s \"Dial M for Murder\" and \"Suspicion\",but has a uniqueness all it\\'s own. It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies. Life is normal for them,until Sally begins to feel ill and restless quite often.A doctor says she\\'s suffering from nothing more than a nerve condition,and she believes that\\'s all it is. She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey\\'s precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called \"The Angel of Death\",was done while she was sick. Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey\\'s next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband\\'s evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn\\'t go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as \"The Maltese Falcon\"or \"Key Largo\",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint. I give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.  ',\n",
       " b'Well, it\\'s an interesting premise, but the director misses most of the opportunities it offers, managing only a handful of suspenseful moments. The film plays more like a whodunit than a horror film, but the \"mystery\" part is dreary, and the death scenes are silly and overwrought. What a cast as good as this one (including Sara Botsford, a real revelation) is doing in an unimportant little time-waster like this is anybody\\'s guess. (*1/2)',\n",
       " b\"If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat... They don't really appeal to me, so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair?\",\n",

       " b'Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks \"What\\'s with SNITCH\\'D\" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film.  Let me clarify some points regarding this \"interesting life experience\".  Originally, SNITCH\\'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG\\'s notorious Experimental Feature contract. But I digress...  I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI... I too believed the myth back then.  Let\\'s just chalk it up as \"film school\" for many involved, myself included. SNITCH\\'D was shot over two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, he is a Drama and English teacher...consider THAT while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast.  Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A.\\'s Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and \"let\\'s do this\" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come.   SNITCH\\'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.  Anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to lend credibility to SNITCH\\'D. Since Cahill\\'s other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it\\'s cover... as so many have picked up this DVD based on it\\'s sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent.   6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.',\n",
       " b'First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews. I never played the game so I had no idea what to expect.  I should know better...  I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, sat down with a low expectation, and cranked up my Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system. Was I ever BLOWN away! It was more than I expected and the characters were not as \"forgettable\" as some critics said. I found the performances of Tcheky Kanyo (Paladin) and David Warner (Admiral Tolwyn) were memorable. Saffron Burrows (Angel) was great, except that she handled her \"crisis\" at the end rather badly. But overall the movie was a treat. I would recommend it for anyone to at least rent this and check it out!',\n",

       " b\"The Boss, filmed from a script by the blacklisted and hence uncredited Dalton Trumbo, starts in 1919 and ends somewhere in the Great Depression. It's about the corruption of a municipal machine that focuses on demobbed doughboy John Payne who, when his older brother dies, inherits his political clout.   On the night of his return he godrunk and married a stranger he comes to scorn (Gloria McGhee, whomakes you yearn for more of her). His only unwavering loyalty lies withan old wartime buddy (William Bishop), who has married the girl Payne loved. So all his passion goes into strengthening his hold over the city, including forging an unholy alliance with the (unnamed) Mafia.  Despite a precisely staged shootout in the train depot (did Brian De Palma borrow from this as well as from The Battleship Potemkin, for The Untouchables?), The Boss is really a somewhat Kane-ish look at the rise and fall of a lone wolf; Payne's tough yet touching performance lends an almost tragic tinge. The result is an involving period piece that dwells on the late fringes of film noir.   (One topical note: the men's costumes were by Dick Cheney.)\",\n",
       " b'\"The Widow of St. Pierre (Veuve de Saint-Pierre)\" is a very unconventional relationship triangle, with resonances of \"Dead Man Walking.\"   Juiliette Binoche is much more interesting and complex here than she is in \"Chocolat\" as a Lady Bountiful who is pushing redemption with more than a tinge of sensuality.  Daniel Auteil who usually plays hapless contemporary men at first looks as out of place in a period costume drama as Harvey Keitel does, but he brings the intellectual and moral sensibility of the 20th century to a true story from an earlier one.  Love and devotion--to a spouse and to duty-- are quietly played out against sophisticated political gamesmanship of a small town.   The cinematography in Atlantic Canada is beautiful; the pregnant pause close-ups are as claustrophobic as living on the island outpost. It was partly filmed at one of my all-time favorite historic recreations at Louisbourg in Cape Breton, Newfoundland.   (originally written 3/18/2001)',\n",

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the people at Nickelodeon and Noggin really know how to reach a toddler's developing mind.

       " b\"This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, as I did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.  If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal.\",\n",
       " b\"Sorry to disagree with so many negative reviews. I have not seen the original with Jack Lemmon and I don't doubt the original is much better than the remake, but I feel the obligation to tell everyone that I really enjoyed this movie a lot, that I love Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, who are in the list of my favorite actors, and that this movie is really funny. Therefore, I wish to recommend this version and I can assure you that you won't regret it.\",\n",
       " b'This film made me so very angry. Like a gruesome train wreck, this film is definitely captivating ... in the worst kind of way. As you watch, you realize that you will never get those 24 minutes back.  The film, contrary to some opinions, is a random jumble of pseudo-psychological images and scenes laden with tacky Freudean cues. This is simply weird for the sake of being weird--not some deep, insightful treatise. This is someone\\'s idea of what a \"post-modern\" short student film is supposed to be. There is no real substance here. Notice that the previous reviewer, Rick Hancox, claims that there is a \"strong message\" though he neglects to mention what that may be. No offense to Mr. Hancox, he is much more optimistic than I.  This film is offensive, in that the people involved in making are obviously talented people with some ability at making films. However, this ability is squandered on such trite, self-indulgent crap.  Please, for the love of God, don\\'t subject yourself to this. Unless you are interested in knowing what Alex de Large must have felt like after undergoing \"therapy\" in \"A Clockwork Orange\".',\n",
       " b'There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick\\'s abundance of clich\\xc3\\xa9s throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.  I\\'d read about Elizabeth Berkly\\'s awful performance in the equally-awful \"Showgirls,\" which I\\'ve never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime\\'s worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn\\'t have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn\\'t a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.  The principal\\'s handling of Liz\\'s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband\\'s initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny\\'s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally-challenged).  The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.  Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you\\'d rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the \"Law and Order\" series\\', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on \"Lifetime.\"  Finally, I found a kind of \"story within a story\" fascination with Josh\\'s concoction of his being the \"victim\" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from \"F\" to \"F-minus.\"  This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour\\'s blank film in the camera.   But the writer(s) here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally \"resolved\" and \"righted,\" this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any \"real world\" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.  This one\\'s a 2* presentation; the second \"*\" because it does have some mild \"fascination.\"',\n",
       " b'The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, gratuitous sex and nudity, murder and mayhem... on paper Tobe Hopper\\'s Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. It\\'s not. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.  There aren\\'t too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the \"When you\\'re as criminal as I\" bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from.',\n",
       " b'Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films. I truly am a fan.  However, I can\\'t help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" is lost in translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. Ultimately though this one just didn\\'t work.   It wasn\\'t that the characters weren\\'t well developed or the plot and content didn\\'t come alive. It\\'s just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. We\\'re taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author\\'s precision. Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here.  I suggest reading the book!',\n",
       " b\"Strangler of the Swamp was made by low budget studio PRC and is certainly one of their best movies I've seen.  A man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears. The old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married.  This movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy too.  The cast includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the Strangler.  Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself. Excellent.  Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.\",\n",
       " b\"But then again, I completely HATED the first one.  The children of Gatlin, who killed their parents back in CotC1, are rounded up and bused to the neighboring town. No investigation, trial, psychiatric evaluations - just taken in by idiots. Along comes reporter Terence Knox, who's having a terrible road trip with it estranged son. They decide to stay in town so dad can get the story and son can act like a whiny punk. Soon enough, the freaky Gatlin kids start getting' religious again and kill a few adults. No one seems to notice they all stand in a pack and brood next to the person who ends up dead. Most of the idiot town gets burned alive at a town meeting but not before some toxic corn subplot is introduced. The movie ends with a good old-fashioned showdown.  In spite of a few decent gore scenes, the grossest scene in the movie is a Terence Knox sex scene that may hold the record for fake sweat in a mainstream movie. Actually, I'm still not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or not.\",\n",
       " b'After hearing about this documentary on the right-wing radio show, Steve Brown Etc., I thought that I\\'d take a look. Was I ever impressed. Essentially, the movie sets out to expose problems within the gay community and their \"pride events\" in relation to charities. The concept at first glance can make gay people very angry about airing their \"dirty laundry\" and rightfully so. Robert Labby (one of the main characters) was trying to do a religious activity in the middle of Sadom and Gamora and failed. What I thought was most important was that this seemed to be a continuing theme. In the lesbian wedding segment we see the preacher from the Joy MCC church conducting the ceremony, after himself admitting that he too is gay. I don\\'t know what the filmmaker\\'s intentions were, but inadvertently he\\'s created a wonderful illustration of how lost homosexual culture is, even beyond the typical stereotypes of drug abuse and sex addiction. It shows the culture to be apathetic and having the misplaced arrogance of a petulant child. There is nothing about the movie that reaches for situations where homosexuals illustrate how misguided their lifestyle is, all of it is natural and undoctored.  surprisingly, Robert Labby, the gay promoter documented in the film, was the guest on the Steve Brown Show, not any of the filmmakers. This made me curious to see what the movie was about. How could a gay man fighting for gay rights come down so hard on his own people? The answer is very clear if you see Selling Queer.  I highly recommend this picture.',\n",
       " b\"This film is awful. The writing is tolerable but the acting is atrocious. The director was so in love with his own infantile pathos that he includes long long shots of guys looking tragic. If this film had a competent editor, it might have achieved mediocre status. As we saw with the Da Vinci Code, when the main actor is flat or bad, no matter what you do the rest of the movie will fail. And the main actor is not just bad, he is utterly inept. Think of the pathetic attempts at dialog in the 12 seconds of every porn film prior to getting down to business--our main actor is as bad if not worse than that.   The only reason I am even bothering to write this review is to talk about the love interest in the film, David Vincent. So far as I can tell, this is his only credit. That's a shame. His performance was subtle and nuanced. If this was his only acting credit, he could have quit his day job and made it as an actor. In the extras on the DVD you can see him reading for another part, the part of the hook up at the very end of the film. That scene in the film is particularly pathetic and tonally wrong; but from the screen test, you can see that if David Vincent had played that part, he could have carried it off with aplomb. Wherever you are, David Vincent, there is no doubt that you could have had a career in film.  As for the rest of the folks, including the director, don't quit your day jobs.\",\n",
       " b\"this is the kind of pussy film that women love. all the females are good, and all the men are evil. no exceptions here. except for kids, of course, who are always virtuous in these American family films.  the most important virtue is fidelity. this gets beaten into a pulp.  what about some sophistication? think of french films where adultery is the norm. and Mormons with their multiple wives. when will America grow up?  and of course as in all American films, in the end the loser-guy reforms, comes around, and conforms to the female ethos. it's a wonder the poor slob, and a doctor to boot!, isn't impotent after going through all the shame, the shame, the shame.  a good antidote to this weepy feely goody film might be Casanova, but i haven't seen it yet!\",\n",
       " b\"Based on a Ruth Rendell novel, this is the tale of a young English girl called Eunice who goes to America to be the maid of a rich family. On the surface she seems to be the perfect worker and an excellent cook, but underneath festers years of resentment at being mocked because she can't read. She also has strange visions with lots of blood, and has a surprisingly quick temper.. a fact that her father has already found out to his cost. Her only friend after relocating to the States is a religious nut who used to be a prostitute, and thanks to her influence, Eunice is slowly pushed over the edge..  This is a rather dull psychological thriller which finally comes to life ten minutes before the end. Of course, by then it's too little too late. Rita Tushingham does a marvellous job in making Eunice a believable character with her solitary ways and slow decline into insanity. However, the screenplay doesn't give her enough to do other than hide in cupboards and peek round doors while listening to secret conversations. There is also a tedious half brother/sister relationship that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor, and a cute dog that always turns up where it's least wanted. This sort of thing was done better in the 90's on ITV when Rendell's books were divided into 120 minute episodes. Here it looks like they've had a bigger budget, but to the script and film's detriment. I give it a 3/10\",\n",
       " b'This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only \"villian\" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.  The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.  This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.',\n",
       " b\"This movie, based on the book by the same name, is a completely false representation of the story. The movie was originally planned to be released by a major studio, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino. But when Stone personally met Noriega, accused the script of being completely untrue. Therefore, no other studio bought the script and the only way to get it released was for a low budget, television release. Biopic? Don't think so. This film is everything but real, therefore you should think of it as a story you could could get lost in, instead of basing your whole knowledge of the events solely on what you see on a screen.  Never believe what you see in movies. That is why they are what they are.\",\n",
       " b\"We held the screening of this film as an event to honour these amazing kids that are around now. The film did an excellent job of introducing the concept into a wider audience than the regular spiritually minded people who would probably have known about this stuff. Some of the scenery was stunning and the story line spoke to every father, mother, daughter,son who has been part of a family system wrecked by emotional unavailability of the members. The influence which Grace had in helping heal these rifts was very real. I am a father of 6 children who also abandoned my older children due to obsessive work and alcohol addiction before I eventually 'woke up'. Then my wife and I were blessed with one of these Indigo's (our little son David) and a 'Crystal' (our daughter Rachel). I now realise that their energies were partly responsible for bringing my wife and I to awakening and now the whole family has healed. After the movie our 25 year old son, who has recently left the Army, gave me a giant hug for the first time in his adult life and said, 'Dad, I didn't know what all this stuff was about that you got into when you changed your life around until this movie and event has shown me and I am very proud of you'. That real life situation shows the power of this movie for those who are ready to receive its blessings. Well done to all the team at The Beloved Community for putting it all together!.\",\n",
       " b'Warning to guys - you will probably hate this movie. But I think most women, judging from the user comments, will love it. This is a quintessential chick flick. It shouldn\\'t be taken too seriously as it is a fantasy piece. You will have to suspend your sense of reality to enjoy this. But that\\'s the point.  At the heart of this story is the idea that we all have one true love we are destined to be with. Call it Fate, Destiny, or even God-ordained - but it\\'s the notion that forces will conspire to put us in touch with our one and only soul-mate.  This movie reminds me of another one of my favorite contemporary movies, Serendipity(2001), in the sense of being destined to find our soul-mate (although it is not a fantasy piece). I think guys probably find the fantasy, imaginary friend notion of IHTBY a little too corny for their tastes. But if you like a good, cheesy romance story, then you should like this picture.  I\\'ve notice several reviewers criticize Rogers for her little girl, squeaky voice. But I think in this role, it enhances the story. If you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up - but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old, when she first meets her \"soul-mate\". I know this is a stretch, but that is how I interpreted it and it worked for me.  I love the sets and costumes in this movie. It makes for a visual feast. Rogers\\' gowns are unbelievably gorgeous, especially the wedding gown at the very end. But even her dressing gowns were quite elaborate, adding to the notion of just how wealthy her family is. I find it hard to believe women actually wore these - they look incredibly uncomfortable! If the beautiful mansion set with the incredible staircase looks familiar, you may recognize it from Holiday (1938), the George Cukor film starring Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. That staircase is just amazing - the most beautiful I have ever seen.  There is one thing I did find hard to swallow, and I didn\\'t notice it until Rogers and Wilde are in the car and he finally decides to marry her. How did he not notice the huge, honking diamond engagement ring on her finger and not know she was already engaged? Also, look closely at Wilde\\'s left ring finger in this scene as well. He looks like he is wearing a ring on that finger that is being disguised so as to not be noticeable. What is that about?',\n",
       " b'I like bad movies as much as the next guy but this one is just BORING. When i first started watching it I was under the impression it was about 70 minutes. I got up to the part where he was about to turn into \"BLACKENSTEIN\" and looked at the box again to read the time. I saw that it was about two hours long and i decided that 45 minutes of torture is enough for me. It\\'s just so BORING the gag of the title wears off quick when you see what it actually looks like on screen.',\n",
       " b\"This movie, while definitely not credible film making by any means(or worth ten stars), is good ol' fashioned, camp entertainment. You have a giant ape, a blonde babe whose nipple pokes out for almost the entire movie, gore, death, and destruction. What's not to like? That said, this is just an adventure movie, and it delivers what it promises: Action, romance, and a giant ape. And it's hilarious to boot! While it probably tries to be serious(well,maybe not) it just comes off as silly. And, this being a big budget Japanese release, the picture looks great while the movie is totally goofy. This is 0one of those movies that's better to find in the dubbed, Amercanized version. It just makes it sound even sillier. Definitely worth a look for all fans of silly cult cinema. Especially silly Japanese cult cinema.\",\n",
       " b'An all star cast leads the best original screenplay of 1947. Cary Grant is my favourite actor, and Myrna Loy, best remembered for her trademark housewife equal in \"The Thin Man\" are two of Hollywood\\'s brightest comics together in a pretty funny film. Throw in teenaged seventeen year old Shirley Temple falling for a shining knight in armour/playboy/artist Cary and her Judge sister, and a fun packed comedy results. Somehow, Cary playing another play boy who the women keep falling for cannot convince me of the stretch.   There are great scenes, notably at the races. This only further proves that Cary may very well be the funniest straight actor to appear on the screen. The supporting cast itself is a great one, and the leads are fantastic.  This film has been well directed, but not enough to meddle in the great performances. Screenplay manages to simply enough combine humour and creativity. A light hearted romp and good entertainment.  It\\'s a little lesser known as many of these actors other films always overshadow it, but it is still a good example of 1940s film making, with top talent at its best.  Rating: 8.25/10',\n",
       " b\"The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. At one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what isn't). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come.\",\n",

       " b'Like most who\\'ve commented, I saw this film with the help of MST3K, and I have to admit that this is one of the very few films I couldn\\'t watch without it (along with the Coleman Francis trilogy and Manos).  There is so much wrong with this film that it\\'s hard to start. The plot (if it can really be called that) is a retread, a boring premise (house with dark secret) that\\'s been done to death in every other horror film ever made. The male lead, Jody (yes, JODY), is an ineffectual dope whose most memorable contribution to the film is yelling \"Zah!\" The \"villain,\" Lucinda, is an ugly troll-like hag who can only spout gibberish when she\\'s not busy hacking useless side characters into giblets. The love interest, Melissa, is a empty-headed ditz whose most enjoyable moment is showing Jody where \"the fish lives\" (and, quite fittingly for this film, is the character with the \"dark secret\").  Combine all this with horribly stilted dialogue (it feels like almost 3/4s of the film is pauses, either between lines or between words) and pacing somewhere between \"cold molasses\" and \"glacier\" (not to mention the fact that the first verse of \"Amazing Grace\" is used about 20 times in the film) and you have a movie that doesn\\'t even manage to be affably mediocre or so-bad-it\\'s-good, much less scary. Avoid this film at all costs, unless MST3K are shielding you from this film\\'s dreadful slowness.',\n",
       " b'\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best Disney works. It has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of England.  It also combines very well live-action and animation. The animation itself is, of course, pretty good. The animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film \"Robin Hood\" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in \"Robin Hood\". Besides, the King (a lion) seems to be a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear does look like Little John.  This movie is often compared to \"Mary Poppins\" with a reason. Both combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and a magical woman. The kids (Carrie, Charlie and cute little Paul) are a bit like the Banks children. Both movies were directed by Robert Stevenson and both cast David Tomlinson. However, instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. With its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to Harry Potter\\'s stories.  The majority of the songs are good. \"The Age of Not Believing\" and \"The Beautiful Briny Sea\" are the very best. \"Portobello Road\" is nice too.  David Tomlinson is great in this film once again. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too: Cindy O\\'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a boy in \\xc2\\xabthe age of not believing\\xc2\\xbb) and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul.  I like the black cat. It\\'s pretty cool. It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series \"Sabrina, the teenage witch\". I find cute whenever one of the movie\\'s characters is transformed into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love them! Even funnier is whenever Professor Emelius Browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he\\'s transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It\\'s really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache.  Overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad. The first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. The ending, however, is weak. That\\'s my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling.',\n",
       " b\"this show is show hilarious! after one episode (i watched it on accident once after that 70's show, which is still the very best show on tv), i was hooked. My personal favorite episode is the one where steven and lizzie each have a respective night out with their gender, where steven, lloyd (my fav character), ron, and marshall (my 2nd fav character)go to a party and marshall gets lloyd's overflow. lizzie, rachel, and a bunch of extras go to a bar and have a good time also. hilarious episode. the most underrated show on tv, and while th andy richter show looks really good, i hope it doesn't replace the best attempt at a new show since malcolm in the middle (fox works wonders by going against convention...look at it, simpsons is a cartoon, 70's show is a period piece, malcolm introduced a new style, undeclared is breaking new ground, grounded for life is flashbacked, titus is hardcore...man i love fox)watch it, you won't be disappointed\",\n",
       " b\"Ghost World is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while. The story was very sweet, and it gives people who are hopeless (like myself) hope. This is because the ugly, but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love! I don't usually see that in todays movies  The movie consists of many interesting characters, and the actors who played the characters did an outstanding job (especially Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi). The settings in the movie was good, and I liked how the movie used different room colors for different occasions in this movie.  There are some problems of this movie: 1. The movie was a little bit long, and sometimes the story drags. 2. Scarlett Johanson character seemed pretty small, it would be nice to more a little bit of Scarlett Johanson character.  This movie was funny, sweet, and interesting. If you are sick of the ordinary teen movies, you should watch this interesting little teen movie called Ghost World :)\",\n",
       " b\"The reviewers had written very positively about this film so I went with high hopes. Possibly too high, particularly when Hollywood is producing poor quality films aimed simply at getting butts on seats. So this is supposed to be a return to quality stuff is it ? Sure it had lovely sets, costume, shots but where were the real characters ? Where were the insights into human behaviour ? It brought nothing new to me at all and I couldn't fathom what it was saying at all. Simply because it was saying nothing. All the characters was far too simple as were the scenes, dialogue and structure. And don't start lecturing me that this is how it was in the 50's. I grew up in that decade and saw films like 'Look Back in Anger', 'On the Waterfront' and 'Rear Window'. Surely what was needed was to bring more characterisation and development of the story, not less. Heaven help us all if this is seen as Hollywood getting serious.\",\n",
       " b'I really liked the performances by the actors who portrayed Charles and Camilla, & also the actress they chose to portray Diana was very convincing in that role as well, so casting was very good. I don\\'t know how accurate the film was, as I don\\'t keep up with celebrity gossip and haven\\'t read any of the biographies on Prince Charles or the Charles/Diana/Camilla situation, but I enjoyed this film. I look forward to seeing more films featuring actor Lawrence Fox. I recognized him as the actor who portrayed a German pilot in the BBC series \"Island at War.\" He really humanizes Prince Charles in this film, I think overall it is a very flattering portrayal, although I don\\'t really like how he and Camilla took advantage of Diana\\'s innocence and youth, they really ruined her life. I gave the film 8 stars instead of 10, because I generally don\\'t like these tell-all types of stories based on celebrity dirty laundry, but it was a good film with good acting; enjoyable overall.',\n",
       " b'I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. On two fronts, however, \"Rob Roy\" scored far above average. First, I have rarely seen a \"popular\" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. There were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. I could give numerous examples, but why should I? Just watch the film. Second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. For a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a really believable villain. If you don\\'t have one, there\\'s not much joy in rooting for the good guys. And \"Rob Roy\" has not one, but three--the Earl of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn, and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, either, but fully fleshed and very nasty. It takes a bit more patience than \"Braveheart\"--there\\'s more dialogue, and the accents are a bit tough, but it\\'s a much more clever and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)',\n",
       " b\"i don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader.......oops,........... James Earl Jones speak, but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not it\",\n",
       " b'I think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn\\'t work. Hydrogen filled flying bladders? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there\\'s the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just don\\'t try to pass it off as fact. Some folks will always misunderstand. All in all the film is entertaining, but I constantly found myself saying \"oh brother, what a load of ....\". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at the very least turn the sound off.',\n",
       " b'Writer/director Moussa Sene Absa shows how modern day(1994) Senegal reacts to having French and American culture thrust upon the native Wolof people, specifically in Popenguine. Absa does a great job of showing the struggle by focusing on two groups of teenagers each with their own idea of cool, and own take on these new cultures entering Senegal. While the groups each try to impress a group of girls with different techniques the townspeople struggle with the change they see in their youth. I think Absa dose a wonderful job showing the infiltration of French culture by using Mr. Benoit, a French school teacher who forbids the children from speaking their native language in his classroom.   Ca Twiste has an interesting story, and sometimes surprisingly good acting from untrained actors and actresses, but suffers from a slew of continuity problems. Lighting changes several times during some scenes, and costume can also be seen changing in a few cases. For someone who has a good grasp of subtitles and foreign movies, Ca Twiste was actually a pretty easy watch. There where some spots where the speaker was speaking so fast that the subtitles remained on screen for only a fraction of a second, not nearly long enough to read through.',\n",
       " b'It is clear this mega howler is a result of the TITANIC juggernaut...if i can actually say that and have it double make sense.... FINAL VOYAGE is surely the unintentional SINKING HIGH (like Flying High) of oceanliner disasters. Yes, a remake of JUGGERNAUT with LAST VOYAGE and BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE stapled on and a TITANIC wannabe...it is in rusty tub terms the equivalent of Behind THE DOOR as a rip off of THE EXORCIST . FINAL VOYAGE must be the full scale cringe on the resume for both Dylan Walsh and (the ridiculously named) Ice T. For this he should be billed Ice Berg...but that sounds like a Jewish Eskmo rather than a black man. Yes FINAL VOYAGE is the last genuine guilty movie pleasure of the 20th century and I advise you all to include it in your treasured library of all star stinkers and howlers....or should I say sinkers and bowel-ers. FINAL VOYAGE is fantastic it is so awful.',\n",

Of course of how MTV is they had to put sex,and nudity in it. I don't think THAT even made it interesting, it just made the movie even dumber then it is! Plus the filming work was terrible because at times it looked like the way they film in the real world series' which doesn't have that movie affect but then at times it did. Well honestly all I can say is that on a scale from 1 to 100 on the bad scale I would give it 120 or more.\",\n",
       " b'Without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS seems to really, REALLY want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it\\'s so entirely valueless on every level that one can\\'t help but laugh. Reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman\\'s films, it follows a city couple\\'s day in the wilderness...they walk along a shady path, allthewhile pontificating like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad(\"I feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate....but is it as beautiful?\") After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening(well...OK...we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene), there is finally a VERY anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair \\'Nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar.   Nothing at all eventful or interesting happens IN THIS ENTIRE FILM. I thought the Larry Buchanan picture \"Strawberries Need Rain\" was a weak example of a Bergman homage. \"Golden Apples\" is every bit as bad, but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful. 1/10',\n",

       " b\"This is a gem of a film. Directed by Craig Lucas (I loved his LONGTIME COMPANION, also starring this film's star, Campbell Scott) it is adapted from the play centering around a young screenwriter who sells his story for a cool million. There are conditions which I won't divulge. See the movie. This is a love triangle in a strange scenario. Lucas brings many moments in this film by a closeup. While going into the internet chat rooms, he pulls out deep and dark thoughts from his leading player.  I thought Peter Sarsgaard, whom I recently admired in JARHEAD, did a remarkable job with a complex and difficult role. He brought a depth to his character. Patricia Clarkson, too, was outstanding. Campbell Scott brought a fine performance to the screen. These three players worked well together. Bouncing off each other like a pin ball machine. Scott redeemed himself with this as producer and actor from that bad movie he made LUSH. I'm not too familiar with Clarkson's work but will certainly look forward to other films after viewing this. Sarsgaard was remarkable in JARHEAD and doesn't disappoint me in this one. Hats off to the three stars and Lucas for a fine job.\",\n",
       " b\"Before watching this movie I thought this movie will be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I previously watched. As far as sexual scenes are concerned I was disappointed, I thought sexual scenes of Dreamquest will be great as Flashpoint sexual scenes but I was disappointed. Except Asia Carrera's sexual scene, any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned.  Although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor, this movie is very good. If typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies. Story, acting, direction, sets, makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great. The actors of this movie done really good acting, they all done a great job. Dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies.\",\n",

The people are going from one point to another point, with really no point (if there was one it was very dull). There was no action, suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless, so there was no caring what happened to them.  All together the movie was pretty boring.  I give it a 3/10.  I like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous.\",\n",
       " b'I just finished the book Peyton Place last night and was excited to get the movie on laserdisc to see how Hollywood interpreted the true to life stories of the numerous characters in the novel. I was horrified to see every female character stripped away of her individuality and independent strength. One character\\'s low-cut dresses and \"easy\" lifestyle are simply explained away by her admiting it was all to get the boy she loved since she was six to marry her. What happened to Matalious\\' strong female voices that spoke their mind and came to grips with their own inner strength. A very disappointing outlook even for a 1957 story. I did not expect the novel verbatim but also did not expect an entire whitewash of the true drama in life. See the movie if only to explain why our parents revolted so strongly in the sixties from the morals taught them in the fifties.',\n",

This movie was so painfully boring that I wanted to slam my head in the seat in front of me! The only thing that saved this film from being a complete catostrophe is Kate Hudson. She once again proves that she is great actress. Too bad McConaughey screws up the film for her. All I have to say is this movie was horrible.

       " b'SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!  2003...within less than a year, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will turn 30 years old. I find this very hard to believe because this movie hasn\\'t aged a single day. And although cinema has gone through a major evolution in the past 30 years, most nowadays thrillers don\\'t come even close to TCM when it comes to atmosphere and \"creepyness\". This is horror in the purest possible form and it\\'ll rank always high on the list of movies that influenced cinema the most. That\\'s probably why some suckers have decided to remake it... By the end of this year, a new TCM will be shown in theaters and I ask you why ? Is it to satisfy younger fans and blow them away with stunning visuals and sound effects. That isn\\'t necessary at all. The original still has the ability to impress any public...and how !!!   The most powerful aspect about this movie is without a doubt the choice of the innocent victims. The diabolical family didn\\'t intend to chase the group of youngsters, they just happened to be there and fell into their hands. It could have been anybody. This form of random terror is usual stuff nowadays but back in 1974, this scared a lot of people. Of course there are many other great elements to find in TCM. For example Leatherface and the rest of his family...( including the Chainsaw ). Never in this movie is really explained what drives them to such madness. Sure you can make up many theories about the fact the closure of the slaughterhouse and such but you\\'ll never a 100 % sure about the origin of the madness. They\\'re freaking maniacs and you don\\'t want to come across them. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one big thrill, in fact. The grave robbing, the terrifying news bulletins and the demonic house ...all these elements contribute in making this movie one of the most memorable and important films ever !  TCM is loosely ( better say VERY loosely ) based on a true story. That is to say : Leatherface owes his existence to the horrible serial killer Ed Gein. Without a doubt the most influential psychopath in American history as he was also the base for other horror milestones such as Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector. We have Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel to thank for all the rest of this terrific movie. They\\'ve created this low budget piece of cinema and by doing that, they changed the horror industry forever. Tobe Hooper continued making good horror during the 70 ( Eaten Alive ) and in the early 80\\'s he even was a star for a little while ! Steven Spielberg let him direct his production Poltergeist which was a huge success as well.  TCM is coming straight from the best horror decade: The 70\\'s. Very recently we\\'ve this discussed this wonderful 10 years of horror here on the message boards of this website. The amount of highlights in this decade is incredible and almost impossible to list...You\\'ve got The Exorcist, Halloween, Suspiria, The Omen, The Wicker Man, Last house on the Left, Dawn of the Dead and tons of other immortal titles. Texas Chainsaw Massacre sure is one of them. This version will always be superior...even if the make 10 remakes and a 1.000 more rip-offs  Greatest \"rewind\"-moment : The character of Pam who fall down in the Leatherface house. When she looks around the camera follows her view and you see nothing but human bones ! Terrific piece of horror',\n",

       " b\"Inuyasha is the best anime series I have seen and the one that Iam obsessed with right now. I love it! It has everything a series should have: well defined characters that make you fall in love with them, humor, suspense, the ability to grab your attention and hold it, excitement, great lines and dialog, characters that have a personality that no doubt everyone can find one to relate themselves and become a fan of, an engaging storyline that doesn't slow down, malicious villains and lovable heroes, great animation and voice actors that have voices that match there characters perfectly. When I was small mostly all my favorite shows were anime and when I grew up and my anime shows all came to an end I started watching shows with people and forgot about anime until Inuyahsa that is. I remember being on the computer and on yahoo's box of entertainment of what the world is searching for I saw that people were looking up anime and a list of the most popular and searched for anime of all time and Inuyahsa was number one. I read a summary for it and become interested so I asked my friend who loves anime about it and he told me it was his favorite anime series right now. I started watching it and immediately I got hooked. Now I watch it all the time. I got caught up on the first 50 or so episodes by the season box sets which are great. I bought them during my march break and watched all 54 episodes in a week, it was awesome. And now I never miss the new ones. I'm always there on Fridays at 9:00 watching it with my eyes glued on the screen and by behind glued on the couch. I recommend it to all anime lovers and to everyone who loves a great adventure with action, romance, lots of humor and unforgettable characters. But a warning it will make you fall in love with demons!\",\n",
       " b'But alas, mind you, this could have been a very good movie..   What this film suffers from, and so many other Swedish contemporary films, are the lack of individuality. The glances towards Hollywood are obvious especially in the editing and the clich\\xc3\\xa9\\'s in manuscript. The script is the biggest flaw here. The historical angle (even though a bit resculpted) works fine, but the dialog is absolutely horrible. And as mentioned the clich\\xc3\\xa9\\'s and straight forward plot could have (and has been) stolen from many American adventurefilms. The camera work are very good, the mis-en-scene works fine as well even though the budget was low. Some of the wholeness and flow is disrupted and destroyed from the editing, especially in the fighting scenes. It seems that sometimes the producer has stepped in and said \"Too little action here boys, fix that!\" The result is just bad version of Matrix crosscutting. Sound works fine as well, works fine on surround. The music tends to be a bit repetitive though. The last twenty minutes plays the same \"tick-tock\" inspired music that has been in every Swedish TV- production since times beginning. (A pedagogical way to show the viewer that time is of essence. Feel free to get stressed.)  All in all it works as a film made for TV. There are some good actors here but they often get nowhere with their twodimensional characters and lousy dialog.   Biggest plus: A daring try to make film out of Swedish history. Biggest minus: The scriptwriter should be flogged.  4/10',\n",
       " b\"Mildly amusing and predictable story. Four ghetto friends get into trouble when one kills a store owner. The shooter goes nuts and begins to cap the other 3, one at a time.  If there is nothing else on cable or free tv then it's worth a look. (I wouldn't pay to rent it). It is interesting to see Samuel L.

I\\'m watching it right now on TV \\'cos it\\'s too hot to sleep (typical Aussie summer, wouldn\\'t ya guess), and, it being the summer \"silly season\", the networks have pulled out their big guns - namely, lower-than-C-grade movies, which basically constitutes the entire Aussie industry.  Even by summer non-ratings standards, this is pretty horrific. Simply, it\\'s another victim of shoddy Aussie writing, bad, bad direction, and normally very good actors doing a damn fine job of being terrible. I don\\'t even remember this film being released commercially, so it\\'s probably some commissioned TV movie that somehow got the green light and is now languishing in the perpetual darkness of a station\\'s archive.  Oh well, maybe we can hope they\\'re only going to screen it once every silly season. The world can only be a better place if it never again sees the light of day. Bonza.  And that is my two cents on another sterling Aussie gem. Chuck us another shrimp, because this one\\'s well and truly over done.',\n",

The Great Vorelli from the movie \"Devil Doll\" builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by Blanchard, a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all of the grants in the world, will be staying in London for a few days. He attempts to project himself into the house of Blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat. The rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are some more killings, some modest paper work, and finally, the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go. Thankfully no one decided to make a sequel.',\n",
       " b'To be honest, I didn\\'t like \"Executive Decision\" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.  Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn\\'t even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don\\'t use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.  You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.',\n",
       " b\"I saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault. As in real life though sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with Leo, who even though I liked his character I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him, and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men. This is in no way meant to bash gays (I am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. The only part of the movie I couldn't understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral.  I think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is DO NOT HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX!\",\n",
       " b\"This absolute trash is based so closely on the Friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy, accept for it being an Australian film with people who can't act.  Once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video. It is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money, see it only out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT to (not be able to) act. Lead role Alan Dale used to star in the television soap opera Neighbours, but ended up in The X Files - how did THAT happen?\",\n",

It\\'s a kind of strange combination of a bio of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids. The vignettes are good (especially Speed Demon), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it\\'s just as weird as it sounds). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!  The real gem however is the incredible \"Smooth Criminal\" video, which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone!',\n",

       " b'The \\'good\\' greatly outnumbered the \\'bad\\' in the first season of \\'Star Trek,\\' in terms of episode quality. In fact, one could argue that the only out-and-out stinker in that opening set of shows is \\'The Alternative Factor,\\' which is confusing to the point of being incomprehensible at times. The universe is in danger of \\'winking out,\\' and if you find the explanation of this phenomenon a little weak, join the club. Maybe it\\'s the 23rd century equivalent of \\'freaking out.\\' Anyway, it\\'s not a good thing, and the Enterprise tracks the source of the trouble to a man on a desolate planet and his small spacecraft there on the surface. The man, Lazarus, is not much help in explaining things either, babbling on and on, sometimes hysterically, about how he has to stop somebody and how Kirk and crew must help him. About a half-dozen times during the episode (seems like more) we are treated to a spinning visual effect that settles on a murky, foggy corridor of sorts where two figures are seen locked in a fierce struggle. Also, Lazarus has a bad habit of falling off cliffs. McCoy treats him for a head injury, and even though he is clearly unbalanced and dangerous, turns him loose to wander the ship and steal a couple of dilithium crystals. When Kirk finds out, naturally being a bit perturbed, he asks McCoy where Lazarus went. McCoy shrugs and says, \"Oh I don\\'t know, Jim. It\\'s a big ship.\" Just totally blows Kirk off. Thank YOU, Dr. McCoy. Anyway, the episode meanders along, and between the spinning corridor scenes and Lazarus falling off a cliff here and there, we finally get to the heart of the matter. A parallel anti-matter universe threatens to collide with our own, destroying everything everywhere. Lazarus has a double in the other universe, a madman, and the only hope is to trap Lazarus and his mad double in the corridor for all eternity. Which they manage to do.

       " b'Before I see on this film, I see a lot of comments, which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad...  What I really want to point out is the acting on Woody Harrelson behalf, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even the intro, I was astonished by Will Smith\\'s and Woody Harrelson \"message\" they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on.  I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. But a act to show redemption, there is not many films that in my point of view can show this. This is one of them that can.  I agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of \"suicide\" is a downfall, however I do not believe that is the \"message\" the film is trying to send, but \"sacrifice\". A bit to the extreme, but that is the message in MY opinion.  This film has potential. The acting it is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person that doesn\\'t really like watching drama films... if you like drama this is a must go watch.',\n",
       " b'Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren\\'t. Most modern horror movies fit into this category.  Then there are those movies that don\\'t simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you to a level that you\\'ve never experienced.  \"Halloween\" is such a film. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all of them work. \"Halloween\" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.  The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after Laurie.  Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance.  I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of \"Halloween:\" \"Because of its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member...\"   He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it\\'s downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). In fact, one can argue that this isn\\'t really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don\\'t do them because they\\'re dumb. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they\\'re idiots, we\\'re frightened because they\\'re making a mistake.  One of the main reasons why \"Halloween\" is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it\\'s real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this film. There\\'s no supernatural, there\\'s no ridiculously creative plot elements, or \"inventive\" murders, or whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we\\'re actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.  Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It\\'s a hit or miss game, which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I\\'m not), they\\'d seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).  Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn\\'t need to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it\\'s hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.  This is Carpenter\\'s movie through and through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie \"The Thing\" supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as \"Halloween.\" Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers \"recognize your potential.\" As good as this film is, it\\'s not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It\\'s not that it\\'s bad, it\\'s just that there\\'s no good reason to fear \"The Shape.\" Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there\\'s no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it\\'s disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that\\'s when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.  While \"Halloween\" may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!',\n",
       " b\"Well, at least my theater group did, lol. So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.  Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.  Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.  2/10\",\n",
       " b\"This is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun.

Think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills McCoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. Despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.\",\n",

I mean, it turns boring because it is the same we have seen a million times: A group of people where an unknown entity kills the others one by one.  Also the characters are not particularly likable so you don't care if they are killed or not. Characters development is very important but the writer did not pay too much attention to this so each person means the same to you.  The movie has some good chilling moments, but it is that kind of flick only enjoyable by teenagers. By the way, there are some cheap SFX at the end that makes you laugh.\",\n",

I\\'m sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10\\'x10\\' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame. I guess they didn\\'t learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene)...wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don\\'t buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine. If it smells like...and it looks like...well, you know the rest.  Avoid like the plague.  edit: Apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since I disliked this movie, I am an \"obvious hater\" which I can only assume means I am phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this wacky, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence (i.e. its refreshing to see...)  Sure, it may be refreshing to see but that doesn\\'t equate into a great movie, just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I\\'d rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalogue than watch this again.',\n",
       " b'What is this crap? My little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie DVD art and title... I decided to watch it with her so she didn\\'t get bored, and I sure was appalled at the horrible quality.  First, the acting was terrible. They seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards. The delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. Scene cuts were terrible.. it looks like they took it straight from the story board, if there was one.  Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes weren\\'t original or well played at all- again, very formulaic. I can\\'t count the times I was able to predict the next joke. I got a few chuckles out of the blatantly \"subtle\" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong?.. c\\'mon! Just.. stay away from this movie. It\\'s not cute, it\\'s not funny, it\\'s not even stupid-funny. It\\'s just stupid-stupid. It\\'s like a PG kids\\' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity, and violence to bump the MPAA rating. STAY AWAY.  \"Would you like to ride my yacht?\"  \"Is that what they\\'re calling it now?\"  \"You could ride my ding.\"  \"Oh! I think I got blood on my stool!\"  Badly played, sir.',\n",
       " b\"I first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally, through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man.  Particularly moving was the Funeral of Steve Biko, made even more vivid and hard-hitting by the South African Anthem played at the time. I have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in South Africa. I consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and I can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just South Africa, but how we as white people perceive black people. I have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed, but after viewing this film I physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible. The greatest reward I can honestly say I have received - to be able to say that in my own small way I have contributed and redressed the balance a little. But if more people thought like me and actually DID something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off.  I challenge any right thinking person to watch Cry Freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in Sharpville for refusing to learn Afrikaans, the senseless murder of Steve Biko, such a champion for his own people's rights, and then, ultimately, to understand that all this is not merely a film, albeit a magnificent one, but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago.  Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard. I couldn't. I was too upset at knowing the truth. That is the hallmark of a great film. It was obviously the intention of Sir Richard Attenborough to get this message over about South Africa. Of course he has achieved it. Unless you happen to support apartheid. God help you.\",\n",
       " b'Paul Reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It is worthy of an Academy Award. This was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reiser\\'s wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running TV sitcom \"Mad about You\". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his dad, and Peter who is now 78 years young made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins. It is a must see movie for 2005. We bet that everyone across all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. We have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different.',\n",
       " b\"Despite the frivolous title, this was a fun and suspenseful film. Holmes has stumbled across a creepy case, forcing him to delve into the psychology of a twisted killer. Rupert Everett is a younger, more dashing Sherlock than we're used to seeing, but he plays the part well. Ian Hart also makes a different sort of Watson, but there is chemistry (and a bit of underlying tension!) between the detective and the good doctor. I'd like to see the actors take up the roles again.  The sets and costumes are wonderful, although many of the scenes are awfully foggy, even for London. Some of the discussions between the characters regarding the murders tend toward being a little graphic, but it is most interesting listening to the rather repressed Holmes discussing the details of sexually motivated crimes! Not an ordinary sort of case. The conclusion is satisfying. Well worth watching.\",\n",

The only thing right in the movie title was \"HAZZARD.\" Was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn\\'t approve of the script. I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks.',\n",
       " b'The director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival Friday night that we were about to see an \"experiental\" film. Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. A meandering pastiche road show manqu\\xc3\\xa9 that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the Castro theater. I would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. By the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. Tepid applause. Pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product. Avoid this film!',\n",
       " b\"If you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium.  Unfortunately the Butcher Brothers haven't grasped this yet.  This film sucks, unlike the majority of its characters who (if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you) preference stringing up the plentiful supply of 'no one knows where I am' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger, past their isolated door.  The only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy.  Forced to up sticks (as opposed stakes) on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are none too bright. If they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate, thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy.  Why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother I am not sure. It added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all.  One was never told why the parents had died, unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason.  The only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like Pugsley from the Adams Family. Indeed he was way too rounded, having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a Weight watchers' class in to a very bad horror film. Oh heavens, he had. Never mind dear, have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre.\",\n",
       " b\"Not as bad, as it's credited to being (Hooper's done far worse)\\xc2\\x85 more so disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, which is never really tapped in to by Hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky (excuse the pun) writing. It goes so sinister and over-the-top in a dead serious tone, becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt. Because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an off-balanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-colour character. Even though it's cheaply done, there's a competent technical attitude to it. However it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some do work) and strikingly steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery (more so towards the latter end), and the camera-work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating. The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but amusing cameos\\xc2\\x85 especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it's passably engaging.\",\n",
       " b\"  ****SPOILERS*****  Long awaited in some circles, this adaptation of Quinn and Vigil's graphic novel is bound to disappoint all but the most die-hard fans of the source material. No doubt Brain Yuzna was the correct choice for this material given his taste for sex and violence, and this could have been a flashy showcase for his new Spanish production company as it looks fantastic (care of A Nightmare on Elm Street cinematographer, Jaques Haitkin) and has has some good FX, but the film goes down in flames fast because of Quinn's convoluted script that throws in everything but the kitchen sink but refuses to define its characters or tell a coherent story. John Jaspers (the ever-mugging Mark Frost) is given a second chance at life by the demonic M (Andrew Divoff- who should be doing better movies) as a razor-clawed assassin. After wiping out a crowd of diplomats (was this ever explained?) he's arrested by a tough cop (perennial Yuzna star, Jeff Colmbs, who couldn't even Re-animate this movie) and interrogated by a sexy shrink who wants to understand him. Of course, M won't let Jaspers out of his Satanic contract, and ultra-violent hilarity ensues, sprinkled with kinky sex and bad one liners. Fast paced and never dull but quite dumb, a frustrating miss.   CS\",\n",

Because others have told the outline of the story, I won\\'t redo that here, but rather focus on why I so completely enjoyed the film. I too saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, sitting in the first row because I was in the \"rush\" line. It speaks to the warm, human, and entirely charming story that I was able to actually stay with it from the perspective being practically underneath the huge screen, looking up, making sure my eyes were looking through the right part of my glasses. As a westerner who has traveled, worked, and loved being in India, I found the writing true to life and always seen from a positive angle. Todd\\'s openness and vulnerability contributed to his steep upward learning curve, and was essential to his success there. We too must be open and interested if we want to live in a world that is increasingly global and challenging. I\\'m not sure how the romantic part of the story will be received in India, should the film get a distributor there, as I have found that most are pretty conservative regarding what they want to see on screen. But I wish the filmmakers all the success, and I hope they make many more films like this one.',\n",
       " b'Vincente Minnelli takes the audience on a tour of the \"how to make movies\" idea in The Bad and the Beautiful, a heartfelt and poignant story about a ruthless producer trying to get back into the position of successful producer with the help of three people he launched careers for. Unfortunately, they all were tragically affected by him in one way or another, so they all refuse. If anything, this movie shows how quickly your fortune can turn in the movie business. Jonathan Shields, played remarkably by Kirk Douglas, goes from poor, unknown movie producer, to becoming one of the richest and most powerful men in Hollywood. This film reminded me of a sort of mix between Sunset Blvd. and Ace in the Hole, ironically the latter being a film in which Douglas also starred in and playing the same type of character. Taking a rather unflinching look at the inner workings of film making and the consequences that come about from such a lavish lifestyle, Minnelli paints a bleak portrait of the people we think have it all. It may not be as powerful or well made as Sunset Blvd, but it still has a great quality to it that makes it one of the better works of Vincente Minnelli.',\n",
       " b'This aired on Disney a few years back as one of their infamous \"Original Movies.\" The concept is something from a \"Simpsons\" Halloween episode: a computer home is won by a family and they move in only to find their lives dominated by a glitch in the system.  In this case the glitch is a visual representation of a woman who seems to think she\\'s the mother of the new family that\\'s moved in...she takes control of their lives and locks them inside the house. Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house, then decides, \"Hey, Dad, maybe we shouldn\\'t have moved in here\"...after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film.  No Disney Original Movie is going to be very good and this follows all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s - bad actors, bad script, inept director at the helm (probably a TV veteran and first-timer when it comes to film-making).  Overall this is not really worth your time as it is something \"The Simpsons\" managed to do in 30 minutes and even their version seemed more realistic and less insulting than this...',\n",

       " b'  At first it might not have seemed like such a bad idea to remake this movie again. Afterall the story of Annie Sullivan teaching Helen Keller communication is timeless and the 1979 version does prove that remakes can still work. So, if they had to do another one two decades later, why cast the Pepsi Girl in the coveted role as Helen?? I read a review that said her emotionless performance should be nicknamed \"Frankenkeller\", because she does indeed walk around like a robot! The only good thing about her performance is that she doesn\\'t talk in the film! She is also too graceful a Helen. Patty Duke, and even Melissa Gilbert had a more wild animal like energy to their performances, while Ms. Pepsi seems bored as Helen (or is it that we are just bored at watching her? Would someone give her a Pepsi, please?? I was totally shocked that she didn\\'t start singing at the pivotal water pump scene \"The Joy of Wa-Wa\"! However, she didn\\'t say anything at all! Where is the emotional wallup that that scene has always brought to us?!  On some postive notes: The sets are grand and so are the costumes. Ms. Allison\\'s performance as young fiest Sullivan can almost stand proudly besides Anne Bancroft\\'s Oscar-winning turn as Anne Sullivan and Patty Duke\\'s Emmy-winning interpretation of her. Do yourself a favor and watch the 1962 and 79 versions, ones that didn\\'t rape such a gorgeous tale. My score: 3',\n",
       " b'\"Bryan Loves You\" is the allegedly true story of an Arizona cult that takes over a desert town and converts its people into Bryans. These people worship Bryan, the son of a king who was killed many, many eons ago. They don masks and go after anyone who doesn\\'t submit to their will, which seems to be no more than one or two people.  Let me lay it on the line: \"Bryan Loves You\" is possibly the most disappointing film of the fall 2008 season. I had been excited about this one since it was first announced... especially with this amazing list of guest stars. The love of my life, Tiffany Shepis. The biggest star in horror, George Wendt. Scream queen Brinke Stevens. Troma head honcho Lloyd Kaufman. And more. However, what this list of names failed to mention was how little any of them were in it (Stevens and Kaufman, under one minute... Shepis maybe five or six minutes, and Wendt five minutes maximum). So if you\\'re watching the film for any of these people, prepare to be let down.  Also, the film works on a \"found footage\" premise, like \"Blair Witch Project\" (which it is compared to on the box and likely in other reviews). But the problem is... it doesn\\'t work. There\\'s too many camera shots, too many cases of scenes they wouldn\\'t film, and many, many scenes where a camera wouldn\\'t be found where the footage was shot. So, its attempt at realism fails miserably on that account. (Of course, as soon as you put real stars or known actors in your film, the amount of realism already decreases... Norm from \"Cheers\" being unrecognizable? Hardly.) The film was still watchable, and while it\\'s not one of the better films I\\'ll be seeing this year, it has some redeeming qualities. The writer-director-actor (Seth Landau) is clearly a talented guy. This film helped him perfect camera shots I\\'d love to see in future films, and his acting is the cream of the crop. He\\'s pretty much the only actor who comes across as believable, with the possible exception of Brinke Stevens (who has too little screen time to judge).  I\\'m unclear how available the film is. Fangoria wrote a review -- far more critical than mine -- so the word is certainly getting out there. But without their approval, what stores will carry this one? Best Buy? Your local video store? Wal-Mart? I have run into it at Wal-Mart in a special Halloween section alongside other recent -- and better -- Anchor Bay titles such as \"Breathing Room\", and I suspect other stores may follow suit... this could turn into Anchor Bay\\'s little mistake of 2008. Anyone who buys the film on a whim is likely to be let down. One reviewer summed it up as worse than watching a \"six-hour musical version of \\'Ben Hur\\' performed by a class of third-grade special-ed kids\", and I think that pretty much says it all.',\n",
       " b'Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a movie? Can just ANYBODY make movies these days? In the past, it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he\\'s made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I DO. Actually I think even I could make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the BTK Killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. THAT\\'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that\\'s in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term \"BTK\" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is that lame \"DAHMER\" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. Whoever made that one needs to be shot.',\n",

A teenage outcast (Rainbow Harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her. Movies like these, the power giver has a nasty side effect. This one changes her inside and out if she likes it or not.  A mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on d.v.d. a few years back. I don't know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie foe some reason. If you do I would like to know why. Until then I dislike this movie and I have no reason to ever watch it again.  Not recommended at all.\",\n",
       " b'In the same vein as Natural Born Killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved, Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act. Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I don\\'t know where, places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just don\\'t understand it. At any rate, Brian and Carrie (Duchovny and Michelle Forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures.  Being artistic types, Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis). Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord\\'s murder so he won\\'t have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. Two birds with one stone, you know.  The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clich\\xc3\\xa9s or even ending up with caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals, but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele, Brian is fascinated with Early\\'s status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early\\'s gun. Never having fired a gun before, he\\'s as fascinated as a little kid. While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early \"broke her\" of smoking and that she\\'s not allowed to drink (Early doesn\\'t think women should), Early and Brian are out at the local bar. Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. \"Hit him, Bri, it\\'s comin\\'.\" This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it\\'s so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy\\'s friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. And besides that, because Brian benefited from Early\\'s actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele, it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.  Clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it\\'s a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. While studying the actions of past murderers, Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it\\'s in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.  I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt\\'s versatility as an actor. Consider, for example, his roles in movies like Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean\\'s 11 and 12. Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable. Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn\\'t get the hair and beard right. I even got the hat right, which initially I thought would be the hardest part.  It\\'s easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience\\'s understanding of its subject matter. A film that didn\\'t glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as Kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brian\\'s and Carrie\\'s fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie\\'s very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.',\n",
       " b\"This may be a very mild spoiler but yes, this film actually had a script. Even more shocking; it actually had writers. I was originally assuming that someone had watched the Mighty Ducks, and switched hockey for basketball, Emilio Estavez for Martin Lawrence, and genuine entertainment for a farce of a movie. Lawrence can at least half-act, he proved that in Bad Boys. So he has no excuses for this. This brought out every tired clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the book and then slowly murdered them one by one. They even had the one training session scene in which everyone remarkably improves, which I thought had been retired forever. Even the obvious love interest was stupidly achieved and pointless. I don't mind a film being a little predictable, but I don't like one in which I can guess at least one in every two lines. This film was purely and simply shocking.\",\n",
       " b'When I first found this film existed on Wikipedia by chance, I read that Filmation, the company behind this movie, was planning on making a series. Unfortunately, their first two films Happily Ever After and Pinocchio and the Emperor of Night were so disliked by critics that Filmation lost its reputation and eventually went bankrupt. Being naturally curious, I decided to investigate the former and see why this happened. True to form, the resulting movie was not so good...in fact, it was downright terrible.  The year in which this movie was produced is almost as unbelievable as the fact that it was able to enlist such names as Ed Asner, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Phyllis Diller into its maelstrom. 1993? Wasn\\'t that about the same time Disney was producing such masterpieces as The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast? By watching this show you would never guess it was made in 1993 because of the grainy, outdated 70\\'s animation. The way the characters move ranges from glitchy (the way some parts of a character are missing) to beyond ridiculous (when Snow White is walking or running). This is way below par if you\\'re familiar with better movies.  Even worse than the chintzy animation though is the writing. The story is more full of plot holes than a slice of swiss cheese. To be exact, my biggest beef with the plot comes from the whole \"Shadow Man\" aspect of the story. It was at the very end when I found out the Shadow Man was really the Prince under a curse that I lost any remaining respect for Malice, the villain. If Malice was such a great villain, why didn\\'t he just imprison or kill the Prince instead of turning him into a creepy little man? At least then the Prince wouldn\\'t be running about saving Snow White. Didn\\'t the writers think of that? And the little \"romance\" between Snow White and the Shadow Man was bizarre and creepy. She knew this little weirdo for what, two minutes, and yet the writers felt the need to make a pitiful little montage of their \"precious moments\" at the very end. The fact that none of the main characters are terribly memorable or endearing also doesn\\'t help matters any. For example, when we meet the 7 Dwarfelles, the only 3 that actually really speak are Muddy, Sunburn, and Thunderella (who by the way has a terrible and pointless song). That\\'s not like in the original Snow White where the viewer is acquainted to all of the Dwarfs, who actually have personalities beyond a few \"snappy\" lines.  After watching this wretched thing, I would fully recommend avoiding this at all costs, if you want to get a nice video for the kids, get Disney instead. As for my 2/10 rating, I did find this very humorous, although not in the way Filmation intended.',\n",
       " b\"Yep - and one of My Favorite Comedies too, that seems to get better and better each time I catch it! That title year is 1954 and young TV comedy show writer (Linn-Baker) gets assigned as the chaperone to former, swinging, - and heavily drinking - swashbuckler movie star on the downfall (O'toole) for one wild weekend in NYC. Loving, glorious comedy nostalgia that is both a dreamy-eyed glance at old-time movie matin\\xc3\\xa9es & stardom as well as a smashingly production-detailed ode to those seemingly innocent, care-free days of the 1950's and its dawn of television.  Bullet-paced and aloof like a sitcom (or a Marx brothers movie), with nonstop parade of quotable lines and caricature-like characters that makes it ideal for multiple viewing... and a mystery why it seems SO overlooked and not rightly revered as one of the best comedies of the 1980's. The star of O'toole shines at its brightest, but down to the smallest role, it's cast to utter completion.... which makes me ask: what ever happened to Mark Linn-Baker and Joseph Bologna?  8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe\",\n",
       " b'Melodramatic, yes, but this movie has some meat to it that I wasn\\'t expecting. Clark Gable and William Powell play childhood friends who grow up to be a hood and a respected judge, respectively. Both have a thing for Myrna Loy, but the expected rivalry for which this plot would seem to be tailor made never comes. Instead, there\\'s a refreshingly serious story about the boundaries of loyalty and friendship. When Gable is accused of murder and sentenced to the death penalty, it is Powell\\'s duty to decide whether or not to let his personal feelings for Gable interfere with his practice of legal justice. Loy pops up throughout, but, unfortunately, she\\'s window dressing. (Side note: My wife and I decided to have a Myrna Loy theme to our New Year\\'s movie night, and rented this and \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer.\" We couldn\\'t have picked two Myrna Loy movies that do a worse job of showing off Myrna Loy). No, this movie belongs to the men, and the whole affair is better than I expected it to be.  Grade: B+',\n",
       " b'I love this movie. Peter Finch stars as Capt. Langsdorf of the German \"pocket\" battleship Admiral Graf Spee. He is perfect; from the almost swashbuckly entrance and dialogue with Capt. Dove, a merchant captain whose ship they\\'ve just sunk, to the trance-like confusion at the end of the film. There are so many great actors in this film its almost like \"the Longest Day,\" except these guys act. Christopher Lee as Manolo, the jealous bar owner; Anthony Quayle as Commodore Harwood; Anthony Newly as a sailor with about three lines that he still manages to over-act; and John Gregson, who plays Capt. Bell of the British cruiser Exeter. Well known, and often quirky co-directors and writers, Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell bring together spectacular shots of many of the actual ships involved in the battle with an almost ensemble-like feeling in the cast. From the British Ambassador with the no-nonsense, sharped-tongued secretary to the goofy-gaucho interpreter for the reporter, Mike Fowler, these powerfully presented characters intensify the real drama of this battle. It wasn\\'t just a sea battle, it was political, involving sailors, spies, and bad cafe singing.',\n",
       " b\"Yes... I love this series. I bought it on the big DVD pack with the complete first season, because it isn't available in German television right now. Anyway, I love it because it's not only the concept which makes it thrilling, even without that real-time style it would be extremely exciting and suspenseful. Also, it stars one of my top ten favourite stars, Kiefer Sutherland, and a truckload of exceeding supporting actors. Elisha Cuthbert, Leslie Hope, Sarah Clarke, Xander Berkeley, Dennis Haysbert... I could go on forever, even the characters who die after two episodes are very convincing.  Overall one of the things you can't stop watching after you've seen five minutes of it.\",\n",
       " b'Those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated George Balanchine production live onstage, or are letting their disdain for the star casting of Macaulay Culkin influence their judgement. The Atlanta Ballet was fortunate enough, from the 1960\\'s to the 1980\\'s, to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the New York City Ballet, and I have seen it live onstage several times. I can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production, and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase Culkin; it was Balanchine\\'s idea to use a child in this role, just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of Marie. The \"heavy\" dancing is left to the adults in the story.  This is deliberately a stagebound film; in a way, it resembles Laurence Olivier\\'s \"Othello\". Exactly as in that film, the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage, but not made any less artificial, and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups, and without the distracting \"music video\" quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated Maurice Sendak-Carroll Ballard version. There are only two false steps in this 1993 film. One is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects (mouse squeaks, the children whispering \"Ma-gic!\" to Drosselmeyer,etc.). Those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any \"Nutcracker\", and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on film.  The other false step is Macaulay Culkin\\'s nutcracker make-up, which looks absolutely ridiculous. When he is on screen as the Nutcracker, rather than wearing a huge mask (as is always done when the Balanchine production is performed onstage), Culkin is actually made up as the toy - he wears what looks like a bald cap, as well as a white wig, whiskers, and a beard. He also has his face rouged up somewhat, and the worst aspect of his make-up is that it is still recognizably his face, amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr\\'s makeups in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (that film\\'s makeup results though, worked spectacularly, as this one\\'s does not). And a comparison with Baryshnikov\\'s nutcracker in *his* production shows how wonderfully creative Baryshnikov\\'s nutcracker mask was - the \"jaws\" actually seemed to move whenever Baryshnikov tilted his head back.  The dancing itself in the Macaulay Culkin version is excellent, of course, except for Culkin himself, whose dancing, as I said, isn\\'t meant to even be spectacular. (The Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in Balanchine\\'s production of \"The Nutcracker\".) The film\\'s colors, though, could be a bit brighter since this IS a fantasy. The choreography is also brilliant, and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from Tchaikovsky\\'s ballet \"The Sleeping Beauty\" - as Marie sneaks downstairs, falls asleep on the sofa, and dreams that Drosselmeyer is \"repairing\" the broken Nutcracker (this sequence was, of course, never included in Tchaikovsky\\'s original ballet---it is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than \"The Nutcracker\").  Those who have missed out on this film, or those who despise (or loathe it) should give it a chance, despite its two big drawbacks. It is far better than it seems when one first hears that Culkin is in it.',\n",

But it\\'s weird!And it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. This was the 70\\'s and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it\\'s like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. It has that \"Manson family on acid\" vibe to it.  I have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie? Maybe they worked in it back when? At any rate, be prepared to lose 80+ min of your life you\\'ll never get back.

Orson Welles plays a highly entertaining Gypsy and even directed a few of his scenes. Matching, and sometimes even topping Welles\\'s fiendish performance is Akim Tamiroff, the sideman actor that played in many of Welles\\'s films from Don Quixote to The Trial. This film is a bit tragic but most certainly charming. There are so many close up shots of Welles\\'s black eyes mesmerizing the audience against a spine tingling score whispering lines like, \"you will submit\" that it makes me wonder why this film hasn\\'t been re-released and put in the \"cult classic\" section of video stores. Good luck finding it.',\n",

I\\'ve been working on a list of my favorite war movies: \"The Longest Day,\" \"To Hell and Back,\" \"Bridge on the River Kwai,\" (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I\\'ve seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot, however isn\\'t a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It\\'s kind of like a traffic accident, though, I couldn\\'t seem to turn it off! A movie doesn\\'t need big money or great sets i.e. \"Twelve Angry Men\" and \"Lifeboat\" to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking?',\n",
       " b\"A slasher flick is a slasher flick, but when the dialog is terrible and the actors aren't much better, it becomes just another ho hum event; one that I am sure that Brad Pitt would like to forget.  Pitt had his first credited movie roles in 1989. This was one of them, and the lesser of the two according to most fans. He plays a dumb jock that isn't even a good jock. Fortunately, he has his girlfriend (scream-queen Jill Schoelen) to save him from the slasher. Why do these girls hook up with the dumb jocks? Maybe because it's Brad Pitt!   With Roddy McDowall, Martin Mull, and Ione Skye's brother (Donovan Leitch) as the slasher, it was fairly predictable; down to the lame attempt at humor with the cheerleader taking off her panties before the game.  I am surprised that the American Legion or VFW hasn't protested the use of the American Flag in this movie. Maybe they figured no one saw it.  I'm not sure if this was released first or Happy Together was. It could be Pitt's film debut. Anybody know?\",\n",
       " b\"Considering that nearly everyone has seen some version of the reign of King Henry the eighth, this shows unbelievably sloppy writing, woeful miscasting in key roles, and reduces the central character to a narcissistic sociopath, and not the deeply flawed but charismatic ruler, scholar and musician he was. It also blithely ignores the speed with which the King degenerated from being the athletic, idealistic, hero of his people to the bloated, diseased, morally bankrupt tyrant he became, as the consequence of his desperate desire for an heir.  The fact that the writers ignored the real drama, inherent in the historical facts, for some cheesy sex scenes with the royal frat-boy depicted, just shows the inherent cheapness of their intent.  Truly the worst historical adaptation I've ever seen. The only good things about it are some excellent actors trying to cope with the dreadful material, and really admirable production values.\",\n",
       " b'Steven Chow has become one of my favorite directors. This somewhat dark comedy pays homage to Citizen Kane, The Godfather, The Shining and The Bugs Bunny Roadrunner Movie. The film has virtually the same theme and setting of \"Gangs of New York\" and still managed to create likable characters. Even though this is seemingly a more serious film than Shaolin Soccer, it still has the playful humor that made it such a fun movie.   Kung Fu Hustle is a great mix of action cinematography and cartoon like special effects. Chow\\'s brand of humor and understanding of new and classic cinema techniques makes him a truly great director, writer and actor. I haven\\'t laughed this hard in a long time. Kung Fu Hustle is what \"Gangs of New York\" should have been.',\n",
       " b'This very finely written & directed film by Anthony Minghella had a very limited run.I just cannot figure this out. AWFUL comedies like \"40 Yr Old Virgin\" play in over 3000 theatres & this real good movie & many other good films like CHILDREN OF MEN have next to no release at all. As per the old song from THE KING & I \"Tis a Puzzlement\"  The title has a few meanings in itself,(SPOILER ALERT) It is not the robbery at the beginning of the film, It is the breaking of the emotions of the characters & entering there psyche, that this film is about.  Jude Law is an architect creating a building at KINGS CROSS a London neighborhood. The area is like a miniature United Nations, We are dealing here as well with the breaking & entering of various diverse peoples thoughts etc,  Robin Wright Penn lives with Jude & they have a delightful daughter about 10 years old with problems as well.  Newcomer Rafi Gavron (one of the robbers who broke into Jude Laws building) is a refugee lad from Bosnia living with his mother played by the magnificent Juliet Binoche. as you can guess Jude & Juliet meet, & have an affair.  Now enter in the picture Ray Winstone as a policeman, & future STAR Vera Farigna as a prostitute., We break & enter into all these persons psyche,due to the clever & skillful screen play by Mr, Minghella.  ASs you can see at times this becomes a bit confusing BUT the acting by all is superb, I wish the Oscar people gave out an award for outstanding cast like the Emmy\\'s & the Golden Globes\\'do. This film would have been nominated. The entire cast is just about pitch perfect.Thanks to the excellent direction Of Mr. Minghella.  A few more notes then I will finish. this is Rafi Gavrons first feature he is only about 20 years old (I did not look his age up), he does portray a slightly younger lad, & I do predict a bright future for him.  Now on to the main star JUDE LAW, When OH when is he going to get his Oscar.. He is like the old time actors from the 30\\'s & 40\\'s . He can do dramatic loves stories, comedies,He even can do villains. & gives excellent performances in all. He has a smile & charm that is dazzling,. in short HE IS A STAR.

It is violent, can be repulsive and disgusting, and is not for everybody. But if you like this type of film, this is a great film. By all means I recomend it highly, especially if you want to see more of Jennifer Tilly than you have before. Definately an unusal but fun (if you are into this type of film) ride.',\n",
       " b\"Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of the '90's, at least, that I have ever seen!!! Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels work together perfectly to make this movie earn a 10!! Jim Carrey is the best actor in the world and one of these days, he has to be nominated for one of his works, he has done so much and has shown that he can do more than silly, toilet-humor comedies. Anyway, Dumb and Dumber is a must see for everyone (except for maybe little kiddies, their parents might want to think twice, but hey, I say, start the tykes early and show them what good humor is!) It's also educational for me, we watched it in high school two years in a row, now isn't that awesome? Or maybe my school is just weird cause we watch Bill and Ted, too.

       " b'Following hot on the tails of the monumental success of the first TV film, Highschool Musical 2 manages to out do itself in the newest sequel of the soon to be long franchise of films to come. Part two finds the entire cast of Part one ready to celebrate the summer, when (with the help and dastardly doings of evil sharpay) the entire school manages to end up working at a posh resort. The formula is still the same: simple plot, swooning girls, and boys with squeaky clean images. This time though the quality of the music has been stepped up a notch, with a more conscious effort to write more theatrical music (with the exception of a few silly fillers). The cast is still strong with Efron and Hudgens leading the pack. Corbin Bleu is a standout actor and gets to show off his potential, and Ashley Tisdale commands the screen with her quirky off beat character. Of course there are the lines that are so cheesy that you laugh out loud, and of course the awkward moments (Efron\\'s \"angry\" dance number comes to mind) but it\\'s still entertaining. The real star though is Kenny Ortega who helms the project and brings some exceptional choreography and ideas to the small screen. Bravo!',\n",
       " b\"My wife and I simply echo the earlier comments - this is so superbly acted and filmed that we immediately wanted to watch it all again. Dame Wendy Hiller shows acting craft at its finest, commanding the camera by her force of personality and subtleness of every facial expression and movement. All the supporting roles are also outstanding. Somehow the film seems to enfold you in the life of the woman who is given so little time to grasp at a life she wished she might have had.  Good news for all admirers: this film is now indeed out on DVD (2006 release), with an interesting lengthy text biography of the novel's author (Vita Sackville-West) among the special features.\",\n",
       " b\"I saw both old (1981) and new Umrao Jaan (2006). The old Umrao, I think, is one of the best movies (Indian or otherwise), at par with any famed-Satyajit Ray. It should NOT be even compared with the new Umrao Jaan. The problem is that it is so good that Muzaffar Ali (the producer of old Umrao from Lucknow where most of the movie unfolds) perhaps cannot make a better movie all his life.  The old Umrao is very restrained, and therefore, a believable story of a Lucknow tawa-if (courtesan, geisha). There are no brave heroes (all flee 1857 Sepoy Mutiny against the English), the robber Faiz Ali dies in an unheroic escape. Owner of house of tawaifs, Madam Khanum, is selfish and exploitative. Nawab Sultan, one of the first clients of Umrao, sees Umarao what she is - a tawaif and abandons her with no compunctions to marry into the wealthy family of her cousin; others hurl insults at Umrao. There is a thin line (if any) between a tawaif and a prostitute/hooker - old Umrao sleeps with Nawab Sultan as a matter of routine, and then with the robber Faiz Ali.   In old Umrao Urdu poetry (ghazal) is shown to be pervasive in the lives of tawaifs and all around her. The dialogs are in lyrical, delicate and local Urdu, difficult to be appreciated in translation. In old Umrao, acting is superb by all. Songs and Indian Kathak dances (minus one by Nawab Sultan) are mostly in context.  Good movies like good books can enrich and teach. Most Indian movies are trash, fantastic escape from reality but not old Umrao Jaan. You could see Lucknow of a bygone era. Sample these:  - pigeon flight contests (or kabootar baazi, a flock breaking pigeons mid flight from a rival flock) - Indian hop scotch (ikkal dukkal) - the earthen stove (or choolha) - the custom of eating with hands in the kitchen on the floor near choolha - the custom of offering for a saint's shrine (nazar at durgaah) - the custom of arranged marriage between Muslim cousins - the custom of purdah, - the custom of eating betel leaf (or paans) and hookah smoking - the tradition of sellers of bangles and shawls coming home - the incompetent contemptible and indolent nawabs who would sell part of the estate for a courtesan  See old Umrao if you have not yet; see it again if you have once. Technically, the photography in old Umrao is not as high quality as in the new one but then in 25 years cameras have improved a lot.  Old Umrao gets 9/10; the new 3/10.\",\n",

From the start to the finish this film had no signs of a script, direction, talent,...the works. If you like cheesy horror films that follow the same mass produced guideline over and over again, then this is your flick. But if you\\'re looking for some entertainment value...something that will peak your interest for at least 2 minutes, then you definitely need to stay away from this one.  Not only are the dialogue and direction horrible, but the actors...if they possess any talent...aren\\'t allowed to show it due to a lack of any kind of organization. The story seems to go everywhere, but take us nowhere. Certain scenes drag on for what seems like hours at a time. And the movie finale leaves you with more of sense of \"Thank God it\\'s over\", then \"Wow, I can\\'t believe she made it.\" For the most part, the producers should have reinvested their money into another project in stead of giving us this one. It\\'s 76 minutes that you\\'ll never get back. (30 if you fast forward like I did).',\n",

It\\'s a shame that most people won\\'t sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn\\'t even show up in the IMDb listings when you put \"Peter Pan\" into the search engine! - is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched. I obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally. Now when I put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison. I suspect Mary Martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b/w Producers\\' Showcase televised version.  As an added plus the disc I got also showed the original commercials and opening promo. How far away the 1950\\'s seem now - such an innocent time compared to today. I miss it.',\n",

A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. We get some gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it.

He had what it takes to project the reality across to us, the viewers. Although I wouldn\\'t want to be in his situation, of deciding on the fate of survivors in a lifeboat, still I felt his decisions were the best that could be done in such an extreme and dire situation. I\\'m sure no one would want to be in his shoes at that time.  Each actor contributed in their minor roles, - nice to see Stephen Boyd in an earlier role - Lloyd Nolan seen rather briefly, and Mai Zetterling as the nurse who was supportive throughout.  Who can say what each and everyone would be willing to decide on if confronted with the inevitable decision of life and death, or basic survival as in this case. It\\'s certainly something to think about in quiet moments.  I found this film riveting throughout as the dialogue progressed and decisions were made, rightly or wrongly, on people\\'s lives.  It\\'s a remarkably realistic revelation of human nature at its best and worse. A \"must see\" for those interested in drama, and particularly in Ty Power\\'s development as a serious performer.

       " b'Like most viewers who saw the English theatrical trailer of Night Watch, they too may have been enthralled by the horror and action. Possibly one of the better story lines of the genre; I loved the idea of the balance between light and dark/good and evil, the special effects at times where pretty cool, the twist was unexpected (to me at least) and the way it sets up the sequels is also commendable. But, whether or not the filming company neglected to give the required amount of money to make this movie a blockbuster annoys me. The cinematography was a huge let down; no special angels or dark contrast, although the startwas OK, but a bit too nice for me. A horror needs to be scary at all times. Also, guns would have been good.  Overall, the storyline would have truly transformed this trilogy into an epic, but whether it was lack of funds or lack of cameras, this was the biggest let down I can remember. Until there is a remake by someone like Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott with $100m in funding, the potential brilliance of this film will remain hidden.',\n",
       " b\"This is a movie which manages to portray the consequences of modern day war on people's lives with a degree of realism that I have yet to see in most other films of the genre - one possible exception being Kubrick's Apocalypse Now.  The most tangible aspect of this realism is found in the fact that no character in the movie can claim to be a 'hero'. The concept of a 'war hero' I consider to be a dangerous pitfall, which many movies of the genre are only too happy to fall into. Probably because it makes the horrors of war slightly more meaningful - and thus bearable - if they are construed as 'obstacles', which the 'hero' must overcome in order to achieve his ultimate aim.  In 'Savior', there are only victims.  The movie explains this by describing war as a state of society where the ones most likely to survive are those who have let go of all values. Notice how neither Guy nor Vera - the main characters - ever fully manage to reach this state of total cynicism even though they both try. This is why a quest to regain their humanity is sure to end up victimising both of them.  In summary, the main achievement of 'Savior' is in making tangible the viewpoint of Thomas Hobbes, who said that war must generally be avoided, because in war, human life is 'brutish, nasty and short'.  Natasa Ninkovic deserves praise for her frighteningly believable performance as Vera.\",\n",

Even the Uncredited roles were played by actors like Lucien Littlefield, Pat O\\'Malley, and Ziegfeld Girl Kitty Kelly.  Woody Allen used this plot as the basis for his \"Curse of the Jade Scorpion,\" also a very funny movie, but too long, too loose, and not as perfectly perfect as \"Larceny, Inc.\"',\n",
       " b\"There have been many film and TV productions of Jane Eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is utterly in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standards of that time. But, it's the performances that are the real pleasure. Don't miss this one!\",\n",
       " b'This whole review is a spoiler, but if there ever was a movie that needed spoiling, this was it. I could also argue that this movie spoils itself and nothing anyone could say will change that. That was the only movie I ever saw where I walked out went down the line asking people if they were planning to see it and begging them to cash in their tickets and do something, anything, else with the next two hours of their life. I actually made my fianc\\xc3\\xa9, her sister and her sisters boyfriend wait to eat until I finished warning everyone in the line, I was on a mission to make the world just that much better. I think I was successful in most cases, many people thanked me. New Yorkers, standing in line in January, thanked me for telling them they were more than wasting their time, they were sacrificing it to the unworthy. Highlander II: The quickening and Serenity mark the ends of the scale upon which all SF movies can be measured IMDb doesn\\'t have a zero rating or I would have used it. It is the cinematic equivalent of absolute zero, and I saw both Toxic Avenger and Battle beyond the Stars in theaters on their respective opening weekends. SPOILER WARNING: This next paragraph contains the spoiler I mentioned up front, skip to the \"YOU ARE NOW BEYOND THE SPOILER\" message to avoid double spoilage. They must have offered Sean Connery a couple of shipping containers full of unmarked bills and the promise that his character would die early in the movie to get him involved. YOU ARE NOW BEYOND THE SPOILER I continue to recommend the original Highlander as a great movie to introduce people to good Science Fiction, but always with the caveat that they must never see the sequel, \"There should have been only one\"',\n",
       " b'This would make a great midnight movie where everyone could throw popcorn at the screen and yell at the idiots in the movie. The U.S. is under nuclear attack, most of the military bases wiped out, radiation clouds spreading across the country. A helicopter is blasted out of the sky between Washington D.C. and New Jersey by a thermo-nuclear blast, and the survivors are discovered by a little boy strolling through blast zone with a stick like Huck Finn in the wee hours of the morning? Who then goes home and gets his mother to come back and save the men? Hello! Nuclear war! Bad time to let your children out to play in the radiation!',\n",
       " b'After watching the first 20mn of Blanche(sorry I couldn\\'t take more of it), I have now confirmed she does not.   Basically, this \"movie\" is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk. It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies (\"Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ\", \"La Folie des Grandeurs\",...): a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a \"finesse\" of direction avoiding the dreaded \"heavy comedy\" stigma.  Unfortunately, the horsey-faced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie. Horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.',\n",
       " b\"If you've seem either AIR BUD or AIR BUD 2: GOLDEN RECEIVER then you've seen AIR BUD 3: WORLD PUP. It has the same storyline as the first two. Josh discovers that his dog, Buddy is extremely talented at soccer so Josh and Buddy join the soccer team. The team goes on a winning streak. I liked AIR BUD and AIR BUD 2, but now the series is just getting tired. There have been way to many animal movies over the past few years. If studios stop making animal movies for a while maybe a fourth Air Bud movie will be refreshing. If there is an Air Bud 4 then it better be better than this!\",\n",
       " b'The mini-series I, CLAUDIUS is one of the best epics on the Roman Empire one can ever encounter. Although it is based on the novel by Robert Graves, the director, Herbert Wise, together with the producer Jack Pullman and other crew proved a respectful independence of portraying particular characters from ancient times. This film stands out among other historical movies at multiple levels.  First of all, I, CLAUDIUS is one of the rare examples of films showing the real core of the Roman Empire. The action takes place ONLY within the walls of the imperial palace. Everything that happens appears to be perceived by the members of the ruling dynasty. REAL WINGS OF IMPERIAL ROME! Conspiracies, poisoning, hatred, bloody desire for power... these are the topics of the film - ABSOLUTELY FAITHFUL TO HISTORY!  Besides, the empire is showed VERY realistically. It is not the glory of victories, it is not the power and triumphs of its leaders, IT IS THE REAL ROTTEN DECADENCE OF ITS REALITY! \"Trust no one\" as Herod says once to Claudius, his dearest friend. \"The battle of Aktium did not look like that\" says Augustus to a poet who attempts to glorify the deeds of the warriors. In fact, only Claudius manages to survive, but not to the end. Even he is poisoned by his fourth wife...   The film is realistic, but it is important to state that it does not exaggerate anything. There is nudity but with respect to film art. It is not the focus. Cruelty is also not the focus as being the goal in itself. The evil is only \"embedded\" in the action. It is not Guccione\\'s CALIGULA which destroys any classics of the movie art by disgusting pornography and horrific cruelty. I, CLAUDIUS is, first of all, a film art.  Finally, it is significant to mention the cast. There are few films, really few, which have such excellent stars. All people perform WONDERFULLY. You watch it and you forget that these are actors and actresses. You think they are real Romans of that time and totally set your mind on the action! It is a very rare experience and that is another reason why I absolutely appreciate this movie!!! Derek Jacobi, Sian Phillips, Brian Blessed and many many others make the film a real pleasure to watch. Especially Sian Phillips as cruel Livia, Augustus\\' wife, gives her finest performance here. MASTERPIECE!!!  I would recommend everyone to see this mini-series. It is a wonderful experience. The history lesson that this film offers is better than studying history in high school for four years. I, CLAUDIUS is the splendor of CLEOPATRA combined with the violence of SPARTACUS, GLADIATOR and the decadence of CALIGULA. Everything is there with an utmost harmony. SPLENDID!',\n",
       " b\"Oh my my was this ahead of it's time or what! The funniest thing out of the 30's that you've never heard of. Super quick, non-chalant humor that's indifferent to weather or not you laugh and that makes it so funny (does not force one joke on it's audience and the effect is so humbling that it solidifies the humor.) Plus a lot of improving from a greatly skilled cast. I do mean great, they were all completely on top of their roles.  I was surprised to see such a sharp funny movie from this era, I mean in the type of funny it is. Chock full o gags and easy to watch the whole way through, I don't think there was one thing wrong with this one.\",\n",
       " b\"Regular readers of my review list will already know that I am a great fan of the slasher genre. For the past thirteen years, I have thoroughly enjoyed hunting down the many rarities that the cycle has to offer and then sharing my opinions with other collectors across the globe. I personally was not over impressed with Wes Craven's Scream trilogy, but I must admit that I have paid close attention to the overwhelming effect that the three movies have had on horror cinema. Just like being transported back to the glory years of the early eighties, video-stores have once again been over-populated with masked killers and screaming teens. After John Carpenter's Halloween kicked off the boom years two decades earlier, the majority of the bandwagon jumping genre entries were American, British or Italian productions. But this time around we have witnessed slashers from as far and wide as Germany (Flashback), Thailand (303 Fear Faith Revenge), Korea (The Record) and even India (Sssshhh). This was the first of two Swedish entries that were released in the same year.  Director Martin Munthe launches Camp Slaughter with an intriguing text that leads us to believe that the events we are about to witness are based upon a true account. Well it worked for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so why not? Next up we meet Constance (Karen Bertling), a middle aged woman who blames her husband for the fact that he never gave her the blonde-haired blue-eyed daughter that she so desperately craved. Instead the couple ended up with a rather dopey looking son called Adrian (Christian Magdu). They say that if at first you don't succeed then try again, and try again she certainly did. Only this time she swapped partners and tried with her own son! Constance's dream to have a blonde-haired and blue-eyed daughter was not fulfilled after her incestrial efforts and instead she was blessed with a hulking maniac that she decided to keep padlocked in an underground chamber for the rest of his life. Twenty five years down the line and we learn that (unsurprisingly) a remote woodland retreat has been built within walking distance of the madman's underground lair. Cue six dumb teens, plenty of beer and a broken padlock and away we go on a murder marathon!   Camp Slaughter was critically ripped to shreds upon release and most of the unenthusiastic reviews that I've read came from Swedish authors. I was expecting something as bad as The Night Devides the Day or Carnage Road after reading so much negativity. The major critical point from the aforementioned scribes was that the cast struggle with speaking English, instead of their native language. I am fluent in Polish, Russian and English; but under the extreme pressure of trying to deliver a convincing dramatic display, I must admit that I'd feel much more confident speaking in my native Spanish tongue. That's why I guess it's somewhat unfair to criticise such a young cast on the quality of their performances. In this day and age, the majority of cinema fans don't have a problem with subtitled features, and perhaps that's something that the producers should keep in mind for future reference. But the biggest problem with Slaughter is Munthe's pedestrian direction. The movie seems to take an eternity to pick up the pace and then when things finally kick off, the shocks always feel somewhat half-hearted. The maniac is portrayed as a retarded bogeyman and he only kills the kids if he inadvertently bumps into them whilst wandering through the woodland. This immediately cuts out the suspense that's usually conveyed in stalking scenes, which only seemed to slow things down even more. It reminded me a lot of that other pathetic Swedish slasher Blodaren.  Screenwriter Alina Warne made some of the most bizarre decisions that I've ever witnessed in slasher cinema. Her peculiar obsession with bunnies (unfortunately not the playboy kind) makes very little sense, and she even went as far as to call the killer Bunnyman? There's one point in the runtime where Constance begins singing (about pretty bunnies, naturally), and for a moment I had to double-check that this wasn't the first slasher musical. Even though its obvious that Warne knew the slasher guidelines inside out, she still breaks one of the most essential traditions of the cycle. Trudy (Erica Earlson) spends the majority of the movie without drinking, smoking and she turns down constant sexual advances from one of the randy guys. So we have an untarnished virgin amongst the group, surely she's got to be the final girl? Well strangely enough she won't be turning up for the sequel. It was quite a shock that she was murdered, especially when every other clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the rulebook had been underlined and dotted. Some of the dialogue is also hilariously inept at best and the feature was in places poorly scripted.   Camp Slaughter has become impossibly rare outside Sweden already and it's only one year and a few months old. I was somewhat surprised then when I read that a sequel is in the pipeline, which must mean that this wasn't as unsuccessful as many would have you believe. I for one don't think that Munthe's slasher opus is as bad as its hideous reputation makes it sound. Unlike many of its cousins, it's competently lighted and beautifully photographed and it has the odd moment of credibility. In fact there's a couple of neat touches on display and as long as the director cuts out the mundane tekno soundtrack and learns from his previous mistakes, Camp Slaughter 2 could be a contender. But for the moment if you must see a Swedish slasher then get Drowning Ghost instead.\",\n",
       " b'Man, this is everything I want while watching a Spaghetti Western, great characters, a solid story, superb action sequences, and best of all a fantastic score that is the just the icing on the cake. Corbucci basically redid \"The Mercenary\" (which itself was a good film, IMO one of the finer Italian westerns out there) which is all fine and dandy with me, back with Franco Nero as a Swede and Jack Palance as a one-handed pot smoking maniac with a falcon. Can\\'t get much better than that. Palance chews and spits out the scenery, watchable throughout and always entertaining. I was sad he wasn\\'t in the majority of the film. Nero/Milian have great chemistry and just look natural up on the screen, going back and forth with one another. The film never lags either, it goes by quickly and probably could have been three hours and I wouldn\\'t have noticed. Franco Nero looks so natural killing various Mexican-Italian (Iexican?) soldiers with a chaingun. The score just puts a smile on my face anytime I hear it, catchy stuff. Morricone is always reliable. I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he\\'s been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone. All and all, I was satisfied at the end and had a cheesy smile on my face throughout the running time which cannot be achieved easily as my facade is rarely penetrated by anything that isn\\'t of the highest quality. This is the full package as far as the Italian westerns go.',\n",
       " b\"Well, it wasn't so much a 'horror' movie as it was a 'horrible' movie.  I expect that this director will go on to make great snuff films and little else. I guess if I was a 15yr old boy who enjoys endless mindless killing interspersed with plenty of tit shots, I might enjoy this POS.  No one else will enjoy this mess. Except maybe former Nazis.  These days all you need to get a movie deal is apparently the promise that you'll employ the producers wanna-be girlfriend and have at least 5 violent gory deaths. Plot, storyline, or talent not included (or necessary apparently)  The only good thing about this movie is that I didn't have to pay for my ticket to see it. :P And ladies if your boyfriend/husband takes you to see this movie, dump him. He's clearly got something wrong with him.\",\n",
       " b\"I would highly recommend this movie! And I certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad! It was with excited anticipation, that I have just pre-ordered it online, I enjoyed it so much! It is not out until February/March 2008, but it will be well worth the wait! But first go and see it in the cinema if you can. There is nothing quite like the Cinema-Experience of a cinema-made movie! Insist that your local cinema puts it on! I went to see 'Seachd, the Inaccessible Pinacle' tonight, down here in London, and was really impressed. It is a marvel: a truly beautiful film set in the Scottish Highlands: you will laugh, you will cry, you will be moved in may different ways, you will be intrigued, and as the story within the stories is revealed, you will be amazed at that revelation.  This movie is in Scottish Gaelic with English Subtitles, but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the Gaelic: I am just starting, and my son does not, nor did many people there tonight, and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means! Superlatives do not suffice! The photography is superb - there is no CGI here, and the movie is all the better for that- here you have true photography! The script is so skilfully and subtly written. The many-layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers. The music is at times rousing, at times haunting, but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance. And the acting? ... it is to behold ... and the actors?... they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film, particularly the two main actors, 'Padruig-the-young' and 'Padruig-the-elder' (A true bard, if ever there was!), who both carried a very heavy load! And the Direction? Well watch out Richard! And the Producer, responsible for raising funding, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors? A task well done! I hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad! And the Gaelic community? Uill, without you it could not have happened! We were told that this movie was made on a low budget, but you would not know it, and I think it might well be because, for what they might have lacked in money, they more than made up for with the richness of the heart, and the warmth and co-operation of the local Scottish Gaelic community.  A heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making, and the sponsoring, of 'Seachd' - M\\xc3\\xb2ran taing! (Many thanks!) From the Gaels to the World! From the World to the Gaels!\",\n",
       " b\"I saw this movie the other night. I can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. The writing, the voice acting, even the claymation. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy. It just doesn't work. It literally falls flat at about every spot possible.  Also, the movie's animation is very poor quality. I know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.  This show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time. Yikes. It really was that bad. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, steer clear from this abomination. My advice: Don't even buy it, or look it up for that matter. Your brain will than you.\",\n",
       " b'Finally, a movie with socially important messages. Yes, it is devoid of violence and vulgarity. Really beautiful settings and magnificent animals. This leaves viewers with a sense of hope and promise. Predictable? yes but so well crafted. The acting was very good and believable. Comning from a family with a small farm, and having a father that too put his hope and faith in race horses, I really connected. Famileis will find many lessons and can use them to make their own lives happier and more complete. I would recommend this to anyone wanting clean entertainment and good feelings. I believe that life can really be this way.',\n",
       " b\"Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly so with the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable.   It was right after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy like teenager. He was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion.  Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them Rooney was playing an adult part. Even in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows.   Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Holiday all the worse because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the father's character played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the inebriated brother-in-law Uncle Sid here played by Frank Morgan and that's the central character.  Gloria DeHaven steps in for Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original play O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code so all Marilyn does is get young Rooney soused.  A lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best, but Summer Holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn.\",\n",
       " b\"I literally almost fell asleep watching this film.  The plot, such as it is, is that a conniving wife thinks she is about to be scared to death by her husband and father in law. Inexplicably, Bela Lugosi and Mini-Me show up (okay, it wasn't Mini-Me, but a close relative of the annoying midget variety)and act creepy while everyone else is barely acting at all.  There is this strange interspersing of scenes of the woman lying on a coroner's slab, adding absolutely nothing in the way of exposition.  The plot, and I am spoiling nothing here, is that the woman turned over her ex-husband to the Nazis during the war, and now he is looking for revenge by apparently peering into windows wearing a blue mask. He is then caught by the bumbling cop and the inept reporter wearing a dress (yes, absolutely no reason is given WHY he was wearing a dress, since he had not been seen any time previously in the movie AND it was pretty obvious he was a man in a dress.)\",\n",
       " b'This \"coming of age\" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.  Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" the film never hits a false note. All the acting is superb. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.',\n",
       " b\"The film was dire in the extreme, filled with bad acting, bad writing and a poorly structured plot. Lines such as 'But you're the only healthy one left!' fail to stand out when written down; yet when combined with the delivery in the film they are poor enough to induce laughter. Fortunately this film managed to achieve the so bad it's good category, one reserved for films which are enjoyable solely through the realisation that although you yourself may not be able to do better, you certainly would bury any attempt this bad deep underground to prevent the embarrassment of having the general public see it.  If you enjoy a bad film and have enough people round to mock it, then see the film. In all other circumstances avoid it.\",\n",
       " b'Compared to their previous live concerts (especially the sound fiasco at the Shea Stadium event, although that was their biggest performance) this album and this concert was the best this band ever made. Judging on the location (the best location to be used--above the roof) and the sound, it was awesome. I liked especially the little bits of fun they inserted here, like afet \"One After 909\", Lennon recites a line of \"Danny Boy\"... Even though it was obvious that the relations between The Beatles themselves were then too strained, they still blasted the gray Liverpool sky with that album.  10 out of 10.',\n",
       " b\"To save people just scanning the first few lines of a review, THIS IS A TERRIBLE MOVIE!! That said, my reasons for it are numerous: the actors either can't act, or have a small grain of talent, which they use to over-act to embarrassing proportions. The plot, such as it is, seems to be the combination of a dozen or so ideas the writer/director mashed together into a senseless heap. Characters appear and disappear at random, and the film is loaded with pointless, confusing cutaways. Dialogue is at best painful, and a number of times comes off as a blatant ripoff of Tarantino's already irritating discussions about nothing (what was with Luke's fascination with mumu's and peepee's? The pair of door-to-door killer's endless discussion of their suits? Who knows?) The makeup effects are average, and the CGI effects (what there are) fall well below average. Being an editor myself, I can confidently say the editing was dismal. And what can I say about the ending? It was all a dream/hallucination/alternate dimension? The best that can be said is that the shots were in focus, and lit well. For the sake of the brain cells you will lose watching this, not to mention the precious hour and a half of your life you will lose, leave this stinkbomb on the shelf of your local video store until they decide to send it off to the video limbo it so richly deserves.\",\n",
       " b\"I was looking forward to watching this movie as the trailers looked good. It is directed by David Dhawan, who has given us a couple of entertaining movies in the past. Shaadi No. 1 has an incredibly large cast of actors and looked like a Hit. A lousy script about 3 guys who want to commit suicide because there not happy with married life (how realistic and funny). They suddenly make a deal with a man to fall in love with his spoilt daughters and dump them. After many appalling flirting techniques, they manage to romance these childish girls. Suddenaly, a stranger comes and tells them he knows about their affairs, and he will tell their wives. It then follows into cheap comedy, that doesn't make you laugh a single bit. Sanjay Dutt is the stranger, why did a Great actor like him make this pathetic movie. Fardeen Khan has given us some good films, but he seems to be making worser movie over and over again. Sharman Joshi was funny in style and maybe the least annoying character in the movie. Zayed Khan gives us another Flop movie, remember (Main Hoon Na = Anybody that makes a Shahrukh Khan film have a big advantage). Esha Deol and Soha Ali Khan give dreadful performances in annoying roles. Ayesha Takia looks sexy as ever and is incredibly cute with the sweetest smile, but her looks couldn't save the film. Riya Sen is another sex bomb, that couldn't save the film. Introducing singer Sophie in a unimpressive role. Finally Aarti Chabria who looks pretty but her acting once again was poor. I would of given this a 0/10, but because of the girls a 2/10. Out of all the girls, i would love to have a three some with Riya Sen and Aarti Chabria. Their is a song in this film Zara zara where Ayesha Takia shows her melon curves, wow i would love to suck them melons.\",\n",
       " b\"Boring. Befuddled. Blah. These are all adjectives that could be used to to describe this lame 70's pilot for a really crappy t.v. show. Like Stranded in Space, this loser show never got off the ground. Can't imagine why. Although, to give it credit where credit is due, Stranded in Space was actually better and more coherent than this dreadful yellowish mess.  There's a lot of 70's b grade actors in this one, from Pernell Roberts to Tab Hunter to Clu Gullagher. Pernell plays the head of security at San Francisco International, and a more annoying, uptight, moralizing, ego-ridden jerk I haven't seen in a long time. That first scene, in which he scares the crap out of an entire plane load of people just so that he can teach a 'lesson' to some Congressman just leaves you shaking your head in disgust. Where's Homeland Security when you need them?  The 'plot', such as it is, is totally incomprehensible. There are so many trailing off plot lines that you could have woven a sweater from them. There was something about some boxes, the wife of a pilot being kidnapped, a weenie kid somehow stealing a plane, a secretary being held hostage, and a weird little scene with Pete from MacGyver getting into a fist fight with a guitar toting hippie kid. None of it makes much sense, and the only closure is the kid being brought down safely(too bad, he was a really irritating kid). The film is so yellow that it looks like the 'before' pics of coffee stained dentures. Everybody is drably uninteresting, and the whole thing could be used as a sleep inducer. A total waste of time, even as an MST3K episode.\",\n",
       " b\"I recall being confused the first time I saw this film, not long after it was first released, probably due to being young and naive at the time. Having revisited the film 30 years later I find that I have been able to follow the subtleties of the plot more easily.  The movie is a commentary on life's challenges and how one young man - Smith (Sam Neill) - responds to some of these challenges.  I like this movie now because not only does it show something of New Zealand's past and the possibilities the film-makers foresaw (some of which later came to pass as part of NZ history) but because it is an early vehicle for several New Zealand film-maker's craft.\",\n",
       " b\"Hi, Everyone, One way to make a movie build as it progresses, is to start with a very boring scene. Leslie Neilsen begins his role here by narrating a training film. We can instantly see he ain't the swiftest. The problem is, it is not a comedy. It's funny sometimes but never a comedy.  The director must be given most of the blame. The cast is OK. Gary Lockwood and Leslie Neilsen should change their roles. Leslie would make a better pursuer. Maybe Nancy Kwan and Gary should change roles. Nancy would be more believable in the fight scenes than Gary.  The actors appear to be doing their own stunt fighting. They look confused. They seem to be trying to remember their choreography while the opponents wait to be punched.  The acting borders on awful. Sometimes it crosses that border. The writing is conventional. You have a super secret agency of the government that is made up of well armed men. They are all very stupid. They have $300,000 to play with that they had hidden somewhere. They film some of their exploits for training purposes, but the films are all too dark to see what is going on.  My guess is that Leslie Neilsen and Gary Lockwood and Nancy Kwan have never got together to celebrate the release of this stinker.  I almost forgot. There is a song in the movie. The girl who sang it was the one who should have been chased and Karate chopped. Actually maybe the song writer should have been the villain.  Compare the beginning speech of George C. Scott in Patton with Leslie Neilsen's speech at the beginning of this movie. George C. Scott had a passion and the words to fit that passion. Leslie Neilsen sounds like a boxer being interviewed after a bout where he was unable to find a neutral corner.  If you want a turkey for Thanksgiving, this might be it. This is the bird that didn't quite make it over the cuckoo's nest.  Tom Willett\",\n",
       " b\"Well what to say about Aquaman, First I thought it was some kind of Joke after watching the Aquaman silliness in the super show Entourage. Where it is seen as an absurdity but with a super director and a house full of cash unfortunately Justin Hartley probably didn't see that much cash thrown his way in Mercy Please Aquaman the TV show. Rubbish is a good one word to describe the show awful is another so no surprise's there for what is a terrible concept.

I give this a 3, and hope your child is not turned off from Elmo by this.',\n",
       " b\"Can a movie get any better than that? I don't think so. Polanski's masterpiece is a statement about how love has no limits and how people are guided by their sexual instincts even if they don't admit it.

       " b\"This is Chaplin's film debut. If it wasn't for that, there's a pretty good chance that this would be totally forgotten by today. Chaplin, in a pre-Tramp role, shows some of the things that would eventually make him one of the most recognizable figures in the world, such as keeping an opponent away from him by using his cane during a fight). There's very little (ok, no) plot development.  This is a Keystone short, so there is quite a bit of slapstick humor. Perhaps it's due to this movie being over 90 years old when I saw this, but I could not tell what exactly happened between Chaplin and the reporter (played by director Henry Lehrman). There are a few interesting parts.  If you are a fan of Chaplin and can't get enough of his work or a fan of silent slapstick comedies, this might be worth a look. Then again, it's only about 8 or 9 minutes long, so if you don't like it, you haven't wasted much of your time.\",\n",
       " b'Just caught this last night on TCM. It\\'s got some moments, but overall it drags. Stoler as Martha has an early scene where she quits/is fired that\\'s priceless and when her mother plays the guilt card on her ... that rings as true to life for anyone raised Catholic. However, as the story progresses and the bodies rack up the film takes on a John Waters-feel (i.e.- Serial Mom). There are scenes that play like comedy when they should be tragic: the lake/picnic scenes w/ our main LOON trying to drown herself stops any pretense to dramatic tension in it\\'s tracks. In scenes that take place in the bedrooms that Martha shares w/ the unknowing, prospective brides there\\'s a \"Throw Momma From The Train\"-feel to them that begs the question why any of the brides-to-be even puts up w/ Martha\\'s awful behavior. Let alone swallow pills pro-offered by Martha!?!  There\\'s some dramatic redemption towards the last ten minutes when the story finally delivers the best sequence as Martha orchestrates the murders (mother and child) that will eventually close the grisly story. The film is terribly photographed and the sound recording is the worst of any film I\\'ve reviewed on IMDb.',\n",
       " b'I\\'ve never heard the legendary radio broadcast (featuring Agnes Moorehead in what has been described as basically a one-woman tour de force) but it had to be better than the overblown movie version, which today emerges with all the entertainment value of a film noir telemarketing call.  Basic plot rips long arm of coincidence out of its socket--screechy self-centered invalid is accidentally patched into phone call where she overhears two men plotting a murder--her own! (What are the odds?)  Then, to expand this flimsy premise to feature-length, a badly-cast Barbara Stanwyck (who appears so robust she looks like she should be out stringing wire on telephone poles herself) engages in a series of frantic phone calls that all invariably end up with person on other end of line drifting into a lengthy, often confusing, flashback. (Or, even more baffling, flashbacks within flashbacks.) Corny, dated, way over-acted. . .and by far one of Stanwyck\\'s worst--and most over-rated (an Oscar nomination for this hysterical performance?)--roles.   Worse yet, rarely very suspenseful, although some viewers will doubtless be on edge of seats waiting for the annoying heroine to get her come-uppance. On other hand, frequently funnier than a call to Dial-A-Joke, especially when Stanwyck (one of the strongest film actresses of that era) repeatedly, and unconvincingly, bellows \"I\\'m a sick woman!\" into the phone at top her lungs.',\n",

Also, I thought that getting bitten by a vampire wasn\\'t enough to make you a vampire, you also had to drink blood from the vampire that bit you. Ah, never mind, it seems that every movie in this genre is making up its own rules.   Sylvia Kristel is pretty bland in a role that a better actress could have done MUCH more with, wears an awful wig, and doesn\\'t provide any nudity either.

Davis and Oxenberg play damsels in distress, but Russell doesn't really take advantage of the possibilities presented by this trio of babes. Grant, in an early role, had not yet gotten down his quirky mannerisms, but shows an affinity for light comedy. While there is some witty dialog, there is too much nonsensical talk.

Roscoe Karns provides some funny comic relief as the photographer caught up in mayhem as well.  J. Carrol Naish is wasted as the brother of the eventual murderer.

The result - silly and terminally juvenile - is a disappointment: besides wasting a good cast (Daniel Massey, Michael Gothard and Cyd Charisse), the sci-fi trappings of the plot are ill-suited to the material; the hokey monster effects, then, seal the fate of this low-budget venture.

       " b\"Being a transplanted New Yorker, I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.  For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.  No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.  A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.  Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, Cusack finds more than he bargained for,  Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do Aiello in.   City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever he's on.  Al Pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His is a complex part, he's a decent enough man, but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York.   For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.\",\n",

       " b'Anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. There weren\\'t too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. Virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of \"political correctness\".   The performances across the board were compelling. I sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. In particular, I found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films I\\'ve seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. The lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that Dirty Harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. This was the only sequel in the dirty Harry saga that equaled the first.',\n",

Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry. Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment.\",\n",

       " b\"As I was watching this movie I was thinking,OK it'll get good any moment...I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. All seriousness aside the best part was when the Wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good. And the tail end was really kind of dumb as well. There was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down. The worse part is there was more talk of the Wendigo then there was Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad,you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie.\",\n",

       " b'Very watchable mid period classic hardcore. The mother/son incest theme I can take or leave but it was convincingly done. Kay Parker as the late 30 year old mother was spot on and gives an excellent performance, with and without cock in her mouth. Her son, played by Mike Ranger is fine but looks a little older than the 19 years accredited to him. There is not too much storyline and everyone seems relaxed and happy with their respective roles. Very well paced, there is for once not a scene that outstays its welcome and with varied cinematography and music (occasionally none!) this looks and feels like a laid back late 70s enterprise. Oh, some great shots out on the streets of San Francisco too as a bonus.',\n",
       " b'Before its announcement for DVD release as part of the fourth installment of Warners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Film Noir Collection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, where it was greeted with cheers of anticipation, I have to admit that I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t aware this particular title had that much of a reputation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 despite the director and star (Sterling Hayden) involved. Having watched it for myself, I was duly impressed though I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite place it in the genre\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top ranks\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the standards set by the invigorating noir style during its heyday were so high.  Incidentally, despite the title (which would seem to be hinting at a broader scale) and its being produced by one of the Hollywood majors (Warner Bros.), the modest 74-minute duration pretty much relegated the piece to B-movie status; furthermore, the filming was reportedly completed in a mere fortnight! Interestingly, it was the follow-up effort (for the same studio) by the team behind the gimmicky horror classic HOUSE OF WAX (1953) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely De Toth, producer Bryan Foy, scriptwriter Crane Wilbur, and co-stars Phyllis Kirk and Charles Bronson.  The plot followed a much-used noir formula: the man whose past comes back to haunt him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as an ex-con (Gene Nelson) is forced by three fugitives (including Bronson and Ted de Corsia), after deliberately compromising his parole and threatening his wife, into first harboring them and then take part in their proposed bank robbery (by which time they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enrolled other dangerous elements to their fold, notably a typically-nutty Timothy Carey). The narrative, then, tries to cram in as many recognizably noir elements as it possibly can: suspense, violence, romance, location shooting, documentary approach (via a systematic police procedural), etc.  For once, too, Hayden is on the side of the law \\xe2\\x80\\x93 CRIME WAVE actually came roughly in between his two most famous noir roles in John Huston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950) and Stanley Kubrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s THE KILLING (1956), both of them classic heist films in which he had played the fated leader of a criminal gang \\xe2\\x80\\x93 though his character is just as cynical, tough and uncompromising as ever. In fact, for the longest time, he seemed merely a toothpick-chewing, thick-headed bully here but, eventually, he gets to show his essential softness in the film\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautifully-handled (unusually hopeful for the genre) finale.  De Toth operated in most genres (albeit tending towards action-oriented fare, despite his being blind in one eye!) and, whether adopting monochrome or color stock, the full-frame ratio or the Widescreen, he could always be depended upon to deliver an efficient, unpretentious, stylish and entertaining product.',\n",
       " b'Movies have changed in many ways since this was made. The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of just a few oldies that I can watch. The casting, costuming and sets are all incredible. Its a good thing that this was one of the first movies shot in Technicolor, as that process holds up really well as you can see in the new ca 2003 DVD release, unlike Eastman color films that have all gone to hell. Fantastic greens, purples etc.. make the movie come alive again. Great action and swordplay along with real chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn makes it easy to see why this is on the top 250 movies list right here on IMDB.',\n",
       " b\"Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. They get to be same ol'-same ol'. Same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill (usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. For instance, I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots.  Subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is more.   I first saw 'The Woman in Black' on the A&E channel. After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television I stopped to watch it. This movie almost has the feel of a 'Masterpiece Theater' production. That was fine with me, I've always preferred British TV & movies anyway.  Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced. But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. The special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy. The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable. Hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc. Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.  The woman only makes about five appearances in the film. Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright. If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. However this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible. The scene where she 'visits' Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror.  This is just an extraordinary film that I think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a zillion more. I haven't seen anything that tops 'The Woman in Black' yet although I'm still looking. This movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment where I almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke to people that I occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that I'd see her staring through my window, etc. Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate. This is how a really great horror film should be. Like a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it, she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late.  Closest thing I have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. I just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a major prize in my collection. Now I'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.\",\n",
       " b'Prime time remake of the classic soap opera. Governess Victoria Winters (Joanna Going) goes to the town of Collinsport to take care of young David Collins (a VERY young Joseph Gordon-Levitt). She stays a Collinwood a HUGE mansion run by Elizabeth (Jean Simmons) and Roger (Roy Thinnes) Collins. Meanwhile, in the local cemetery, good for nothing Willie Loomis (Jim Fyfe) opens a coffin looking for jewels. This resurrects Barnabas Collins (Ben Cross) a vampire and he proceeds to attack the Collins family while romancing Victoria who is the resurrection of his dead fianc\\xc3\\xa9e. Got all that?   I\\'m a big fan of the old TV series. It was badly acted and moved slow but it was full of vampires, werewolves, ghosts and witches and it was never boring. It played on afternoons (around 3:30 or so) and kids ran home to see it. In 1990 NBC decided to revamp it as a night time soap and started it off with this 5 hour movie (shown over two nights). The plot for this was a combination of the old TV series and the \"House of Dark Shadows\" movie. The acting is pretty terrible. All the younger women in the cast are beautiful with limited acting ability. It\\'s pretty obvious they were chosen for their looks and nothing else. Going is OK but the rest are hopeless. The same goes for the guys (although Michael T. Weiss and Gordon-Levitt try). Ben Cross, in the main role, is tall and handsome but lacks the charisma to make Barnabas work. (In Cross\\' defense he hated doing the series--and it comes through loud and clear). However it does have an eerie atmosphere, was shot on beautiful locations and was pretty bloody for a TV series. The fast pace helps too. This led to a short-lived (4 months) TV series which wasn\\'t bad either. So this is worth seeing but it ends with a cliffhanger leading into the series. I give it an 8.',\n",
       " b'\"Smart House\" is a lightweight, but enjoyable family comedy, made by Disney, about a family winning a state-of-the-art house. The special effects are okay, as is the acting.

       " b\"I've finally found out the reason why the High School Musical phenomenon is such a success. Why the first movie's soundtrack was the top-selling CD of last year. Why there are ice shows, stage productions (amateur and pro), karaoke CDs, and karaoke DVDs to boot. It all traces back to the 90s.  You see, the 1990s gave birth to NSync, Backstreet Boys, the Spice Girls, Britney, Christina, Jessica, what have you. But their time wasn't meant for the 90s. They had come too early. Music honestly wasn't ready to cycle back to the confectionery, syrupy, Velveeta meets cotton candy of the late 50s/ early 60s. But now is the time.  The reason that High School Musical, and now Part 2, are such a success is because 1990'S POP MUSIC IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!! High School Musical was the Reset Button, if you will, setting kidz-bop-pop back in its rightful place. Adults have their music, their innuendos, their profane-angry-paranoid-hurtfully honest songs. Why not give the kids a break? A place to be a kid?   The sequel does a great job of avoiding the urge to fix what's unbroken, but instead to polish it. This film isn't darker, but it is spunkier. More attitude, and even more confidence (if that's hard to imagine). This film is strictly for A) kids, and B) people who not only remember but enjoyed being kids. High School Musical 2 is a burst of joyful exuberance. Winks towards adult audiences have their place, but so do productions where a kid isn't talked down to or expected to grow up too fast.  The straight-up theater pop of the first has been replaced with more of a Hip-Hop/ Arena Pop edge. Less Broadway, more Billboard. Plus, the mythological task of defeating high school cliques has been replaced with simply earning a check for the summer. The movie wants to feel bigger than the last, but it's actually more intimate. That's an unintended plus.  The cast goes through some drama this time around, and some changes are made, character-wise. This was the biggest surprise. Disney Channel could have simply done a rehash of the first film, but everyone involved truly did a great job. I forgot that, as corny as the premise - the whole franchise - is, these guys can really act. And sing. And dance. No wonder Disney gonna's make a fortune.  And no wonder musical theater is so rough. Every single participant has to be a Triple Threat. But that's part of the fantasy of the first film: making the audition, giving it your all, and gaining the applause and support of your peers. What's great about this second movie is, really it's about the reverse of that. LOSING the support of your peers. Losing yourself in search of something you don't really need, not yet anyway. It's a good message: The future will come soon enough. Enjoy being a kid and being with the ones who love you while you still can.  Still, if this second movie doesn't match up to the first, it's because of moving it away from the dream of Triple Talent Status. No longer a musical about a musical, it instead becomes a musical about a country club. Instead of risking social status to be yourself, to find yourself, it is now about the dangers of losing yourself, by giving into social status. More dramatic, sure. A stroke of genius, I would say, except for the fact that it's still a freakin' High School Musical movie, not a Country Club Musical movie.  By moving into more complex territory, it grows up. But by default, it is less fun, just a smidgen less, than the original. To its credit, it isn't stale (the new setting keeps it fresh), but Disney Channel, Ortega, and all company involved will be hard pressed to create a three-quel that's just as fun, lively and CHOCK FULL OF 90'S POP as the original. A return to the theater would be welcome.  As for the songs themselves, let's just say I've been fair enough to comment that I enjoyed the MOVIE for what it was. Disney's been great at soundtracks but they'll have to do a lot better for part 3. Aside from the opener and a baseball game/swing number, there's not much to enjoy this time around, once again due in part to the removal of the high school locale.  The kids will LOVE IT, the parents will Tolerate it, Disney Channel will collect money hand over fist, and everyone else will have no idea what is going on because they've failed to realize (A) what it meant to be a kid, (B) that 90's Pop Music is back with a vengeance, and (C) everybody wants to sing and dance, even if they don't want to admit it.\",\n",
       " b'As nice, simple, and uplifting as this movie is. There is one big problem. And I am not talking about the complete lack of explanations and important information left out of the movie. I\\'m talking about the fact that it is made by Naomi Klein, a hack! Her stupid \"No Logo\" bullshit only translates to other areas of media, now in the form of this Mocumentary. Let\\'s just think here, what is the other option to Globalization? Oh ya, Nationalism! Oops I almost forgot about that, how important it is and how easily it leads everyone down the path of the dark side. It brought us great men like Hitler, Stalin and Mao. Yay for them, but it\\'s just too bad all those people had to die. You die-hard leftist morons are living a Utopic dream which can only be realized in Thomas Moore\\'s book! Utopia literally means \"no place\" or \"no where\" and it is safe to say that you guys are always heading in that direction. But I do not doubt that you are making progress in that endeavor. Klein and Lewis are hypocrites. Just look at the places Klein lives in; She has houses in some of the most expensive places in the world. Look at the value of her place in Toronto! These people are like shepherd\\'s of thought, they say \"Do as I say, not as I do.\" Why? To make money and in particular to take yours! They are simply different vessels of the Capitalist thought that is within everyone, and as long you love and support them they will continue to make millions off of the ignorant. People like Klein and Lewis deserve nothing more than the inside of a prison cell with a single copy of the Communist Manifesto to keep them company and to remind them of where it gets people.',\n",
       " b'Sequel to \"Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus\" *WARNING* - Spoilers ahead! Hopefully not enough to ruin the whole movie, but you have been warned! I comment on plot devices, so it would be somewhat spoiler, but the review doesn\\'t work without the information Well, I saw the first in the series (noted above) and didn\\'t think much of it. With the framework in place, I thought this feature might pull it together better, however. Wrong.  In brief, Crystal Bernard is Beth, the fianc\\xc3\\xa9 of the heir to Santa, (played by Steve Guttenberg as Nick).  Beth\\'s Mother is a harsh dictator who rules with a iron fist, and when Beth turns to her when it appears that she can\\'t put together the marriage she wants in time for Christmas Eve (long story) she brings the fist down on Beth.  OK, lets look at the problems: VERY slow pace. Wastes the first hour wandering about plot-wise, then when the Mother is introduced, she is impossibly harsh (so harsh that the plot device of Beth asking for her help isn\\'t believable, an elopement (or suicide) would have been more believable (and quicker!)) Steve Guttenberg plays his part as a total nitwit. So annoying that it isn\\'t funny. In the first movie he shows some brains/parenting skills. Nothing here, just dumb.  The end of the movie wraps up in the last 10 minutes! So sugary I just about gagged, with WILD changes of heart that were completely out of character (Come on, should of used some that first wasted hour!) These actors are able to do MUCH better work. This was SO dumb I was happy to tape over it.  Let me offer some ideas: The Mother should have been much softer (or does she really hate Beth that much?) to begin with. Not being a Santa believer is fine, but...  Next, have Nick win her over some, like Beth. A last minute solution made this a waste of time.  Also, why CAN\\'T we take the characters to the North Pole? Other movies have done so with some plot device for some continued disbelief.  UGH! I wanted this two hours of my life back. (I kept watching HOPING it would get better) In short the best part of this movie is the advertising spot!',\n",
       " b\"Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the 'How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes' award. Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.  The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husband's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.  The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.\",\n",
       " b'My dad first told about this movie a while ago. Back then I thought it sucked, but a couple a months ago I was strolling through my video store when I decided to give it another try.

Get it if you can find it seeing as how its distributor \"Lightning Video\" has gone out of business.',\n",
       " b'I know that this film is now at the 10 year mark. However, to me it is a true classic. The film is almost like a really good book. You can stop it between chapters and not miss a beat. It has fantastic acting and a dynamite cast. Some have said that they thought the first story with Gena Rowlands and Wyonna Ryder was weak ,but I disagree.That story was about someone being content with who they are not looking for the brass ring. It also left the door open for further possibilities. I loved the New York story for many reasons . Not the least of which is that I live in New York. Excellent casting and a real story of the immigrants who came here to New York and the melting pot we are here in New York. It also showed a real problem that minorities face here in NY trying to hail a cab.  Each story had a really excellent theme. The confession theme in Italy had me rolling , while the story of the Helsinki cab driver was really tragic. If you look at how the film begins and ends, there seems to be a opposite end effect. The affluent casting agent stepping off the private jet versus the worker stumbling out of his cab into the morning.  This is an excellent film with an excellent cast. I highly recommend it!',\n",
       " b\"Neil Gaiman wrote an excellent book, Neverwhere.  Someone decided to make a TV mini-series out of it.  Unfortunately, they sucked.  The director didn't go to film school apparently. Even with the obviously very low budget, there were very, very, very basic errors that could have been easily fixed. For instance, at the end, where Richard marks out a door - the Marquis opens a door that is an entirely different shape from the one Richard marked out. Now, even though they most likely couldn't afford a special effects shot to show a dissolve from the drawing to the door opening, they could have easily made the door they built resemble the one Richard drew. Or far more easily, have had him draw a door that was the same shape as the one they built.  Really simple errors like that are rife throughout the production. The concept of 'lighting' was obviously never studied by the director - it comes off looking like a live stage play in some spots, with very, very bright spots and very, very dark spots. While that may work on a stage, it doesn't on film. Any director worth his salt would understand this. Heck, high school students in America understand this. There's no excuse for it on this level, no matter what the budget. And in other spots, it can't even be excused by the idea that perhaps the director had only done lighting for live theater before this - it's simply bad, bad, bad, bad.  The sound is incredibly hokey all throughout - it comes off as if someone scored the movie with a 1980's casio keyboard on demo mode, with very tiny electronic drums and problems that indicated time and time again, whoever did the sound had never studied sound design. Or that if they had, that they were just really, really, really bad at it. If that was true, why were they being paid to do it in the first place?  The actors are... OK. Some of them have talent, others very obviously do not. None of them do a very good job of it, though the odds are that half of it is more the fault of the director than it is their own. However, that's still half on their part that they suck at. As a previous commenter noted, they make mistakes that belong in high-school level plays. People who get paid to act shouldn't be making those sorts of mistakes.  The set design was another abortion in the making. While it's obvious they didn't have much money to work with, what they did have could have been done much better. The London Underground just looked... Bad. It's not hard to fake something that looks like a sewer city. If they had used less, they actually would have made it look better.  Good writer, good story, horrible production. If you're a big enough fan, you can sit through the thing, but... 'Sit through' is the best you'll do.\",\n",
       " b'It seems quite churlish to excuse a novice director\\'s first feature-length outing (especially when you have not yet made one), and since this director, Marfield, was introduced at \"Deepwater\\'s\" SIFF screening this past June, his direct and humble appearance made it a film you wanted to like. Unfortunately, \"Deepwater\" is fraught with the flagrant over-eagerness and lack of restraint that can plague younger director\\'s first outings (which is forgivable), as \"Deepwater\" doesn\\'t so much resemble a movie as a does a really long movie trailer, vigorously painting the lily when you\\'re already working with a pretty narrow flower.  Set in an anonymous rural America (though it\\'s swamp setting seems to illuminate that this is either in or nearby southern Louisiana), we first meet it\\'s sort-of hero Nat (Lucas Black) as he\\'s just being released from a mental institution, headed towards Wyoming to become a sheep farmer (or something like that). That night, however, he\\'s involved in a violent barroom brawl with some pinhead regulars, though by the end of the altercation he is able to swipe the keys from one of their swanky new vehicles.  After the car dies down on a sheep-infested road, he meets a local hotel owner Finch (Peter Coyote) who\\'s car has just been flipped over, though leaving nary a physical scratch or a speck of dust on his slick, white-bullet of a suit (which precisely sums up his personality). After they have the obligatory introduction, he invites Black to come work on his old, somewhat corroded hotel, for which he seasonally operates as well as doing unexplained \"business\" with various, shifty-eyed local merchants.  Of course, not everything is quite what it initially seems, as Nat begins to realize perhaps something more sinister and deadly in Finch\\'s rather clandestine way of bringing home the bacon. From locals turning up dead, to law enforcements repeated intrusions on Finch\\'s hotel property and large sums of money arriving from an unexplained origin, something is seriously (and perhaps dangerously) awry. And when Coyote\\'s young and lovely new wife Iris (Mia Maestro), initially resistant at first, vigorously seduces Nat and then hatches up a scheme to pilfer Coyote\\'s \"reward\" money and escape, everything seems to be set. However, Nat unfortunately never realized it\\'s often his own perception that can turn against him.  At it\\'s heart, \"Deepwater\" is a very conventional neo-noir exercise in style, and yet it\\'s so luridly over embellished and so relentlessly over plotted (none of it\\'s excess with any plausible purpose or destination) that it just becomes one ridiculously defiled, incoherent mess. We get (for a brief example) endless fast-forwards and clamorous musical cues, a prolonged and visually peppered-up boxing training sequence that looks like \"Rocky\" on acid, a zoom in on a man\\'s intestines getting pecked at by vultures; none of it mattering (or bearable) in the slightest. You almost wish they would\\'ve told the predictable story of self-delusion in a straight, lucid manner, rather than an all-out assault on our eyes and cerebral digestion. Stale, perhaps, but at least a modestly indulgent distraction.  \"Deepwater\" occasionally shows some visual promise (though the deafening score and hazy rapid-zoom through a supposedly drugged-out forest during the starting credits instantly concludes that this is going to be quite unwatchable), as the moss-green and vibrant navy blue color schemes occasionally create a vivid, believable atmosphere of swampside congestion and fear. And Lesley Ann Warren, as a somber waitress forever confined in small-town despair, hints at a potentially affecting performance if the script ultimately didn\\'t eventually turn her character into a nondescript plot device.  Hopefully we can pardon David S. Marfield\\'s first feature as a well-intentioned but completely turgid would-be potboiler, and perhaps if he finds time to relax and cannily craft a film with a decisive identity, he could very well find his own voice in popular modern noir. Until then, \"Deepwater\" is a serious no-no.',\n",
       " b'\"Cannibal Man\" by Eloy de la Iglesia is a notorious Spanish shocker about slaughterhouse worker named Marcos.He works in a canning plant attached to the local slaughterhouse.One night,he kills a taxi driver in self defense and then strangles his girlfriend,the only witness to the crime.Desperate with fear,he murders several other people.\"Cannibal Man\" is a slow-paced Spanish shocker that contains some graphic gore.The film is also extremely stylish and the atmosphere of decay and frustration is simply overwhelming.It certainly gained some notoriety as a former video nasty in the UK,but it\\'s nowhere nearly as explicit as for example Lucio Fulci\\'s gorefests.However the most interesting fact is that Eloy de la Iglesia was one of the major directors to push Spanish censorship boundaries with this film and a number of powerful gay-oriented films like \"El Diputado\" or \"Los Placeres Ocultos\".So if you are a fan of Spanish horror give it a try.8 out of 10.',\n",
       " b'Allison Anders motivation in making this film may be obscure, but I\\'m glad she made it. This, her debut feature, runs like a meandering stream through rivulets of teenage angst and single-mother frustration in small town New Mexico. Maybe its\\' the Mexico bit that made this movie seem more foreign than traditional action-based, marketing-oriented, formulaic American movies.  I\\'d heard the term \"trailer trash\" via Jerry Springer and guests, but this female family of free (alright, forget the alliteration - three) are far from \"trash\", just down on their luck. The mother, Brooke Adams is a waitress on a low income trying to bring up her girls; the older one, Ione Skye, discovers through a fraternisation with a gallant, geologically quizzical Englishman (for once, not Hugh Grant), that relationships beat one night stands.  Ione\\'s brother, Donovan Leitch, also appears in this film, but it is Fairuza Balk as the younger teenager, who is outstanding. She wants the best for her mother, which she has difficulty in securing, but her film-buff instincts and a predilection for Spanish movies, enable her to find fulfilment for herself.  The movie concludes in a somewhat enigmatic manner without all loose endings tied up. But hey, when in life are any loose endings tied up? Our end, like this film\\'s, leave us wanting more.',\n",

       " b\"This was excellent. Touching, action-packed, and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend. I cried, laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The ending wasn't twisty, but it was still excellent. If you like escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect. Something for everyone.\",\n",
       " b\"I won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground.  Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the film very much. Peter Falk's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film.  A small scale 'road trip' movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in upstate NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film.  Very well written with an adult target audience in mind. Plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family.  Really can't say enough about this film except that it's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does.  It's great to see Falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it. It proves that his famous friend & writer/director John Casavettes was right in casting Falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s.\",\n",
       " b\"A mysterious killer, dressed in black leather and a motorcycle helmet, is offing the staff and models at an agency/studio; risking their lives, Magda and Carlo (Edwige Fenech and Nino Castelnuovo), a couple of photographers, attempt to discover the murderer's identity before they too become victims.  Andrea Bianchi, director of cheesy fun 80s zombie movie Burial Ground, makes sure that this enjoyable giallo lives up to its wonderfully lurid moniker by packing it with tons of nudity, sleazy action, and violent deaths. From start to finish, hardly a minute goes by without either a bloody stabbing or some gratuitous T&A from one of its delectable female stars, which is great news for fans of the genre, particularly if they enjoy their movies on the 'trashier' side.  Sexy lead lady Fenech obligingly strips nude for the audience on several occasions, but it is Femi Benussi, as aspiring model Lucia, who really steals the show: with her stunning looks and a winning set of curves, it is a real shame that she falls prey to the leather-clad psycho so early.  The story may not be anything particularly special, but the marvellously un-PC content (slutty women are treated like dirt by chauvinist men), endless hot Euro-chicks, and a magnificent funky soundtrack make this one a guilty pleasure.\",\n",
       " b\"I used to like Jet Li movies purely for the fighting, depicting a rare style and grace; not unlike the master, himself. Li's characters often portray the martial arts code of honor very well. Of course, his evil doppleganger in The One does not apply here. I'm finding that I'm drawn more to his sense of honor that are the cornerstone of his characters; more than the fighting. The action and fighting scenes haven't lost anything, but I think I'm seeing more of his honor code than I used to. He has true style that reminds me of Bruce Lee. His modest demeanor and silence until it's time to use lethal force... it's very refreshing. You can tell he's in control from the second he walks on to the scene without any lame phrases or quirky little acts that are fine for other actors, but not a master.  What worked: It was really cool and mesmerizing to see Brigette Fonda in this film. She does messed up and screwed over really well; and one can actually feel her frustration and hopelessness. A natural prelude to her trust and confidence in Li's character. Of course Li's performance was a picture of style and prowess.  SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER What didn't work: Unlike my usual inclinations, I actually wanted the cheesy to happen in this film. I don't want to ruin any ending elements, but for once I wanted the two characters to find love... it definitely leaves that option out in the open. Other than that I liked the film just fine. There were some elements that were a little predictable, but it helped make me feel like I'm smart.  8/10 - Overall, very good... not excellent.  thank you\",\n",

       " b'I always wanted to know what Monasteries are like. Quiet, Peaceful places of Contemplation and Compassion? And in today\\'s time where almost everybody writes a book about almost everything, it shouldn\\'t be a problem to find out. But I had no luck so far; until I have seen this movie (it\\'s really a documentary).  This movie was shot on a single small camera (I\\'m no expert) using the light that was available at location. Some of the shots are very grainy (see above, I\\'m no expert), those make a very dramatic effect. And apparently, it took 16 years for the monks to grant the filmmaker permission to film. And even then, only on his own, no artificial lights.  The film has almost no dialogue (no need to learn Latin to understand the movie) and is almost 3 hours long. The camera freezes on a certain scene (like somebody in prayer) and stays there for a few minutes and then it goes to a different scene. I was especially impressed by the recording of the changes in the seasons. The beautiful location somewhere in France is highly suitable for that type of movie. Large amounts of snow followed by birdsong and lots of greenery in summer. Combine that with a tremendous ability by the filmmaker to compose the pictures and you are in for sensational treat.  But it doesn\\'t stop there, for the film takes you into the Monastery,i doesn\\'t look in from the outside, it tries to look in from the inside. This is not a documentary telling us \"How to be a Monk in 10 easy to follow steps\". It rather explores the silence and the solitude. One of the repeated shots is of a red candle flickering inside a glass, no noises whatsoever, just the red glow using a tele lens. Other shots are of monks in deep prayer or engaged in their other activities.  The film doesn\\'t explain why these people choose to live a life like that. Nor does it explain the level of self-sufficiency. But what it does explain is the material sacrifice and the related spiritual freedom.  I know that I am not the only one in today\\'s society to suffer from the stresses of 21-first century life and the constant noises of our cities. And probably from the breakdown of moral and ethical values in our society. I admire the monks that they are able and committed to that kind of life. It certainly appears to be a lot more difficult than to choose which TV channel to switch on (or other mundane tasks).  I always considered going into monastery as a step too far. Not anymore now, but I fear it is still a step too big for me.  A final note: this movie lasts for about 3 hours, and it is a very encouraging way to assess your levels of patience and consideration, and several people walked out when I watched it. But the reward is exceptional, I came out a slightly different person. And even if you are not interested in Religion or Monasteries, the photographic value of this movie is more than anything I have ever seen before. The shot selection and composition is outstanding !',\n",
       " b\"I really enjoyed this movie, when I originally saw it on Sci-Fi's Anime week on Robot Carnival. I was upset to NEVER see this movie again, outside of the fact I taped it. It's very difficult to find, and a definite Anime classic. The animation was good, the story was fun (a rip-off of Aliens? What? Not sure where anyone got that idea). I'll say that, yes, most of the characters get killed off, but the alien in this film is inspired and truly horrifying. The way the faces morph out of the side of the thing, implying the alien has eaten the crewmembers' souls - wow. You never know where it's going to come out of next, and the plot twist with the crewmembers' cat and LILY cat (the Companies' spy) is inspired. The ending is left with only two characters left - hopefully they're compatible (though I will admit the Blond was very annoying), because it seemed very much as though they were headed towards an uninhabited planet to start a new life as the only survivors. I jump every time I see this movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime.\",\n",
       " b'I want to make this perfectly clear. I\\'ve heard lots of people talking about this Monster From Green Hell film. It\\'s all the rage with the kids today, I know. Well let me tell you what you\\'re getting into with this film. There is no single monster in the film, there are several giant moths, that might be construed as monsters, but that would make the title MonsterS from Green Hell. Also, this Green Hell is talked about, I think, hard to hear through the terrible sound quality, but we never see it, and I\\'m pretty sure these moths didn\\'t come from Green Hell. Plus the film\\'s in black and white, thus there\\'s no chance of seeing anything green. The proper title\\'d be Monsters from Dark Gray Hell. But I guess that doesn\\'t have the same ring.  This is a very bad, boring, long, repetitious movie. By general movie standards it\\'s quite poor. Next to movies like Orgy of the Dead, it\\'s damn near watchable. A bunch of scientists end up making giant wasps (Hate it when that happens) so they have to trek through darkest Africa to stop them or something. They honestly don\\'t seem intent on stoping them, nor are they truly prepared to handle them when they find them (A good deal of the crew are slaughtered).  The effects are bad, but you won\\'t notice since the big bugs only appear in a cameo role at best...they\\'re there in the beginning once or twice, then disappear until the \"action-packed\" finale. The rest of the time we\\'re forced to sit through a rather tedious walk through of Africa, complete with stupid narration, idiotic characters, and some rather racist stuff as well (The white characters get a whole bunch of Africans to do all their dirty work for them, it\\'s really all quite racist). And the white characters, well they can\\'t get much whiter. One of them dresses in white as well, like Tom Wolfe on his most white day.  Racial politics of the fifties aside, this movie isn\\'t much fun, nor is it scary or even campy. In a word: bland.',\n",

       " b\"It's weird how the writer/director of such exciting blockbusters such as ID4 and The Patriot could create such a strange film. I'll try my hardest to recount the plot.   Two ultra-cheap filmmakers (art reflects life) have a great idea for a movie and rope in an unwilling but attractive starlet and make up a Muppet-like monster based on the photographs of a long-dead grandfather's butler. A rival studio producer wants to blow up the grandfather's house as the climax to his big budget movie so the butler's ghost comes back to possess the Muppet doll to lead them to hidden billions in the cellar.  It's not a bad film, by no means, it's quite cringe-worthy in places but inconsistently entertaining. There are no big name stars or SFX but that is made up for with bizarre plotting and storyline.   This film is more in the style of Roland Emmerich in his Making Contact/Moon 44 days. But if he had the budget he gets these days who knows what this film might have ended up as. I give it 6/10 for weirdness, plot and defying convention.\",\n",
       " b'I picked up this movie in the hopes that it was a good suspenseful ghost story. That is not what I got.  This movie must have been produced on a shoe string of a budget, from the odd camera angles to the meandering around the plot, this movie was a big disappointment.  I do believe it had the right ingredients, but just needed more direction and some better actors. The only thing that kept me from turning it off is my curiosity of just how bad this movie could get.  The ending was abrupt, leaving all sorts of questions in the viewers mind. Much like this review.  I do not recommend this flick.',\n",

One of the most outrageously funny satires I\\'ve seen in a long time. Satire? Somebody asked me. Well yes, satire. A realistic, daring, clearheaded, masterful satire. We live in satirical times, we have no choice in the matter. It takes an artist of Beatty\\'s caliber to turns things around and makes us laugh and shiver at this mess of our own making. After seeing \"Bullworth\" I felt compelled to revisit some of Beatty\\'s earlier work as an actor or producer or director. From \"Mickey One\" to \"Reds\" passing through \"Bonnie And Clyde\" and \"Shampoo\" not to mention \"Heaven Can Wait\" Mr. Beatty\\'s legacy is one of amazing consistency. As I smiled enjoying his funny portrayal in \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" with Vivien Leigh, I thought: that beautiful man is not just a pretty face.',\n",
       " b\"I used to hang with Kevin Rapp, when he was making this film. Making this film on a shoestring, editing on a home rig, using money from his day job as a CSR to pay for film and actors. No studio machine, no investors.  Is it a classic? No. But it is very good for what it is. The direction shows style and promise and an attention to detail I respected then and respect now. The script is clean and the dialogue well-written (I would go out to lunch with Kevin and we'd discuss dialogue, seeing as I am a writer...I got paid in steaks and fries).  All in all, I would like to see more from my friend. He makes me realize that the film industry isn't completely glossed over and weighed down by the commercialization of the art form.  Side note: Dean Anzalone, the menacing presence in this film, was the collections manager in at the firm Kevin worked at. He has a nice menace to him. I'd pay up, if he ever called me.\",\n",
       " b\"This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in 1930s Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period.  The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver. He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources. This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen.  The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous. Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films.  I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, or environmental causes. It is a movie for families as well, however children under 10 (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot.\",\n",
       " b'Another episode from childhood that, as an adult, I look back on with a different perspective. This was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my adoration of this show. However, on viewing this episode after 20 years, I\\'d say it is definitely one of the lighter ones, played for laughs and amusement, instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this, their first and best season. Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R&R too! As Mr. Spock would say, the story just isn\\'t logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, Mr. Spock\\'s final one at the end--when he asks the Captain, McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R&R and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says \"Fascinating...\" in only the way Mr. Spock could do that. An interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying \"amusement\" of Disneyland, for example), being able to have one\\'s wishes actually come true. Really, a great idea but not that well executed. And coming from Theodore Sturgeon, another of the great SF short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that Sturgeon turned in.  Now, here is a little trivia I learned on this very site: In 1987, James Gunn established the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short science fiction story. And I\\'ll quote the rest from this site: In 1968 he {Sturgeon} wrote \"The Joy Machine\", a third script for the Star Trek TV series {Amok Time the other}, that was never shot. The main reason that it wasn\\'t used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. However, the script was adapted into a book by Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek #80, The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996.  I\\'d sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if one doesn\\'t think too much about it. Just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.',\n",
       " b'Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they\\'re going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.  This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent). The premise, about people who\\'s lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, COULD have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film. Instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I\\'m suprised it hasn\\'t been banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well. Oh you figure it out.  A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it.  If you\\'re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it \"a right laff\". Everyone else, run, don\\'t walk away from this sorry little misfit.  And one question, when the group left the \"boring\" seaside town (Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film), to go back to Glasgow, WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England?',\n",
       " b\"Now, i hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything...except this movie. And i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was, and didn't bother with a good performance. This movie is a unintentional-comedy. Some of the lines just crack me up. And them there are some lines that make no sense, and it seems like Tobe Hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW the plot is BAD! But it one of those films that is TAHT BAD that its actually PAINFUL to watch. I recommend this only for BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.\",\n",
       " b'I have to agree with all the rest of the Reviews. Matador has to be one of the best TV shows ever made. All the actors are the cream of the Danish acting world. The Director was the best in the business for bringing Danish Life to Life, so to speak. I am amazed it has not been shown on British TV as it is very comparable to that other magnificent British TV drama \"When The Boat Comes in\" I would be hard pushed to say which one was better. But Matador has a longer run and does manage to cover the German occupation of Denmark. Which will be an eye opener to the British public if shown on British TV. So I do hope somebody gets the courage to show this on UK TV. As it is just a great TV Drama about families and the stress of the new on old ideas and values. So it still has something for today\\'s TV audience. I have never got tired of watching it. Its called Matador because that is the Danish name for the board game Monopoly.',\n",
       " b\"I just wrote a review for STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and that makes this review VERY difficult, because I really can't decide which of these two films is better. To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs. It's sad really, as just after these two triumphs came the sound era--and a seriously negative down-turn in Keaton's career, as MGM repeatedly gave him terrible material--pairing him with the brash and inappropriate humor of Jimmy Durante.   This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the humor and plot. It really never lags and is both exciting and funny throughout. And, for once, I have nothing critical to say about the film. No matter how many times I see it, it just seems perfect. This might just be my favorite silent comedy--period. It's that good.  By the way, while all is practically perfect in every way about this film, this is NOT my favorite Keaton full-length film. While not as funny or filled with amazing stunts, OUR HOSPITALITY is an amazing film for its artistry. In addition to being the prettiest of his films, it also features among the best characterization for Keaton--with a full and rich plot. My advice is to see THE GENERAL and OUR HOSPITALITY and see two very different and probably equally great films from a master.\",\n",
       " b\"First some background; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games at 'The Den' and most other London club grounds. I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.  a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is.   Please my American and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us all not to notice.\",\n",
       " b\"Viggo Mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden (Played well by Lane Smith) has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life. When I think prison movies, I always think action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However I didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of Exorcist III. Prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of Renny Harlin's career. The movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. Lane Smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual clich\\xc3\\xa9 of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations.  *** out of 4-(Good)\",\n",
       " b\"Awful awful awful.  I kept wondering if this movie wasn't made in 1928, not 1958.  War of the Worlds was made in 1953 and is like Star Wars compared to this movie.  I could make this movie in my backyard with a camcorder and a $1000 budget. Okay, maybe not.  Sound editing was crappy, special effects (if you can call them that) were bad, acting was pretty bland. The storyline was bad.  The costumes were okay, that's about it.  I saw it on Turner Classic Movies, but I still want my money back.\",\n",
       " b'Doll Face proves the point that all old movies aren\\'t classics. In fact, Doll Face proves the point that most movies, whether made 60 years ago, 30 years ago or last week, are deservedly forgotten because they age so badly.   This guy-has-doll, guy-loses-doll, guy-wins-doll-back story gives us Doll Face Carroll (Vivian Blaine), a burleyque star with a great voice and a big following among the bald- headed set, and Mike Hannegan (Dennis O\\'Keefe), her manager and the impresario of the burlesque house where she stars. Doll Face wants to go legit as a singer on Broadway and Mike wants to help her...but her notoriety as a burlesque queen gets in the way. So Mike cooks up an idea to have a noted author ghost Doll Face\\'s memoirs and smooth over the rough spots. Doll Face will get culture and that will get her legit stage offers. Ah, but the author who agreed to be the ghostwriter happens to be a very handsome guy. Wouldn\\'t you know it, misunderstandings arise between Mike and Doll Face. But everything works out. A producer puts on a Broadway show based on Doll Face\\'s hit memoirs. Doll Face not only stars but so do all her pals from Mike\\'s burlesque show, which means Perry Como, Carmen Miranda and Martha Stewart. And Mike manages to win back Doll Face\\'s love, along with 25 per cent of the smash show.   We get Como and Stewart singing and sort of dancing to \"A-hubba, Hubba, Hubba,\" Blaine, Como and Stewart separately and in various combinations singing \"Somebody\\'s Walking in My Dreams,\" Como fronting the girls with \"Red, Hot and Beautiful\" and crooning \"Here Comes Heaven Again,\" plus Carmen Miranda rolling her hips and eyes while trilling her r\\'s through \"Chico Chico,\" the big production number. The songs by Jimmy McHugh (music) and Harold Adamson (lyrics) are professional but that\\'s about it. The only song that became a hit was Como\\'s recording of \"A-hubba, Hubba, Hubba.\" The big Latin production number with Miranda looks like 20th Century Fox was economizing. In this black-and-white movie it badly needs color and Busby Berkeley. For about half the movie, when guy loses doll and before guy gets her back, Doll Face the movie flops into angst and anguish, with over-acting by Blaine and far too much screen time with her and her ghostwriter, Frederick Gerard (Steven Dunne). Dunne was probably one of the handsomest actors never to make it. He had a smooth, assured voice perfect for radio. He can cock an eyebrow but he\\'s as bland as Como.   What drives the nail in, however, are the rest of the actors. Dennis O\\'Keefe was a versatile guy, but even he can\\'t make Mike Hannegan interesting. O\\'Keefe has to speak with a \"funny\" Brooklyn accent most of the time, something that sounds like journeymen Hollywood writers trying to channel Damon Runyon. He\\'s stuck wearing a suit with padded shoulders, wide labels, a bow tie and a pork-pie hat with a snap-brim. This is someone\\'s idea of a guy from the funny world of burlesque. At least O\\'Keefe is actor enough to bring some humanity to Hannegan. Vivian Blaine, on the other hand, was an actress who, at least to me, always came across on film as so polished and professional as to be bloodless. She\\'d hit her marks but not your heart. Blaine made a big hit on Broadway four years later as Adelaide in Guys and Dolls, so perhaps movies simply didn\\'t do her talent justice. As far as Carmen Miranda, she\\'s Carmen Miranda; you either like her or after a while she gets on your nerves. Perry Como is so laid back he seems half asleep most of the time. The standout, for me, is Martha Stewart. She\\'s vivacious and knows how to sell an upbeat song.   But let\\'s hear it for the people who never get a mention; in this case, a bit player named Charles Williams. He was a small guy with a little mustache and an energetic manner. Did he ever get a credit line in any of the movies he appeared in? In Doll Face he has a tiny part as a drug store clerk reading a notice to Mike Hannegan. It\\'s not much but he makes the most of it. For those with long memories or big DVD collections, you might remember him from Vogues of 1938. Williams plays a customs clerk in a big production number. We\\'re watching him through a window where he works. For about two minutes he goes into a song and dance, not quite imitating Eddie Cantor. That\\'s all the screen time he has. It\\'s funny and first- rate, and he didn\\'t get billing there, either. (Dennis O\\'Keefe was in Vogues, too, as an unbilled dance extra.)',\n",
       " b\"Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything...\",\n",
       " b\"Eddie Izzard is a one-in-a-million comic genius. He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense! Get a copy of this now, you won't regret it! I give this an 11 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'Senior citizens can be shrill, depressing, and very boring, so you might think a movie that casts old people as \\'hit men\\' would be good for a few laughs. \"Homebodies\" tries but fails. It\\'s just a silly film about greedy land developers trying to knock down the house of some stubborn old people, who in turn start picking off the workers in an attempt to stop construction. All the characters are annoying caricatures that\\'ll be grating on your nerves after the first 15 minutes. Save yourself the trouble of searching out this movie and just go volunteer at a nursing home.  3/10',\n",
       " b\"I'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. The little girl was a brat, their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked. Besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe. If you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a Crocodile, not a gator. Obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc. It is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the ending. I nearly fell asleep with this one.\",\n",
       " b'ELECTION NIGHT is a clever film about racism. The film begins with a man meeting a friend at a bar. When the friend says on off-hand racist remark, the first man confronts him instead of sitting silently. While almost impossible to believe, the first man then realizes that the election is being held and he forgot to vote--and runs to the polls before they close. On the way, again and again, he gets in cabs where the drivers are total racist pigs and are amazed that he\\'s offended--as if everyone of \"us\" is in agreement about \"them\". This is an interesting idea and didn\\'t come off as too preachy.  When he finally did arrive at the polling station, there was a very ironic little twist that made the film and made me think of the saying \"no good deed goes unpunished\". The only sour note to the film was the very last scene in the bar--it was really impossible to believe that this one incident at the poll could change such a good man so quickly. Still, it was a very clever and interesting film.  By the way, this film is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. On this DVD are 16 shorts. Most aren\\'t great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it\\'s an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying.',\n",
       " b\"Slaughter High starts like any other day at Doddsville County High School where little minx Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) has tricked resident nerd Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower, while doing so Carol's gang of friends come in & give the now naked Marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an April fool's day joke. The school's sports coach (Marc Smith) saves Marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame Marty, they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & Marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face. Years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school, they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there. They all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as Marty is back & has revenge on his mind...  Originally shot under the title April Fool's Day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named April Fool's Day (1986) made the same year this American English co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors, George Dugdale, Mark Ezra & Peter Litten (after never seeing a film with three credited director's I've now seen two in a week the other being the Jean-Claude Van Damme flick Kickboxer (1989)) & I have to say I really rather liked Slaughter High even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation. One of the things I like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules, short comings & trappings & plays up to them. Basically it delivers what it promises, a homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes. I thought the character's were alright, the story was OK even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & I actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which Slaughter High gets a lot of flak for. The first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another. Some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining?  Despite three credited director's Slaughter High turned out pretty good, I liked the look of the film a lot. The isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good, the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow Carol through various corridors of the rundown school. While not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made. There is some good gore here including burnt bodies, people melted with acid, impalings, stomach explosions, axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain! The special effects are also better than one would expect & I was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count.  Technically the film is better than I had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today, I would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though. Supposedly set in America this was very obviously shot in England. Harry Manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from Friday the 13th (1980) & it's sequels. Anyone living here in the UK will probably recognise Billy Hartman who played Frank as a regular in Emmerdale Farm (one of our nations top rated soap operas) in which he plays Terry Woods! While most horror fans will recognise the sexy Caroline Munro in a rare staring role. Legendary exploitation producer Dick Randall did the deed on Slaughter High & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer... talk about typecasting! You can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was Pieces (1982) which he also produced behind him in his office.  Slaughter High is a slasher film that I liked a lot, did you see that? I didn't say it was great I actually said I liked it on a personal level & I'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so I can't recommend it but I can say I liked it, make of that what you want. Make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out. If your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then Slaughter High won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this.\",\n",
       " b\"Fourth film in the MGM Tarzan sequence is a great step up from the last film, Tarzan Escapes (what a dog that one is).  Here the film has Tarzan and Jane having a baby boy brought to them by Cheetah. The baby, who they name Boy, was orphaned when the plane he was flying with his parents crashed in the jungle. The crying baby was rescued by some chimps not long before the plane is discovered by unfriendly tribesmen. (we later learn the parents fates). Five years later an expedition comes into the jungle looking for the plane and some sign of the people on board. It seems a vast fortune hangs in the balance of the location of anyone on board the plane. Will Boy return to civilization or stay with Tarzan and Jane? Good film is a nice step forward in the MGM Tarzan saga.The plot moves along at a good clip, has some great thrills and keeps the stock footage to a minimum. To be honest I can't really say that any bit of the story really stands out but at the same time I enjoyed the film the entire time it was on.  If there are any draw backs to the film it would come in two places, first the basic structure of some one coming into the jungle to find some one, Boy here, Jane in the previous two films, was clich\\xc3\\xa9 almost from the get go. the fact that the studio got three films in a row from the plot line shows the films have more to them then the well worn plot lines. The second problem with the film is the long sequences where Tarzan and Boy frolic. Its good in that it establish father/son bonding and their relationship, but it kind of goes on and one too long. Worse its all variations on the Tarzan Jane frolics from the last two films.  Ultimately the pluses out weigh the minuses so this is a great little adventure film. Definitely worth your time.  (Addendum and possible spoiler: I can't believe that MGM was going to kill off Jane. I'm curious has to how the final sequence was suppose to be played since the scene as it stands now is a bit silly with Jane suddenly better.)\",\n",
       " b'Gandhi my father is like viewing a book, chapter by chapter you read it(with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and for that matter Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. The title misleads though, its as much a movie about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as its about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles.  Such movies are like leap years. They come after only so much time.  Gandhi My Father, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken.  Watch it, if you like quality cinema.',\n",
       " b'A whimsically breezy surface makes way for a bang-up, ball-breaking and noisy spaghetti western by the talented Sergio Corbucci (the man also behind \"The Great Silence\" and \"The Mercenary\"). Actually I might still put those two films ahead of this one. Hell, there was an explosion of excitement ringing from this this highly competent and vivid outing. The cheeky style dripping from the fascinating material was well placed and delivered. Even from the action, the grand state of it feels like something out of a comic strip and how can\\'t you love the flat-out, bloodthirsty machine gun activity towards the finale. What a sensational climax it builds up to!   The trio of Franco Nero, Tomas Milian and Jack Palance were nothing but marvellous, and the chemistry between the former two was a blast. But Palance\\'s sophisticatedly leering menace was the real draw-card. Fernando Rey makes for a solid turn too. Ennio Morricone plucks in with a gleefully passionate and killer music score, which is one of his best and the rugged location was captured by Alejandro Ulloa\\'s free-flowing and expressive cinematography that had plenty of poignant scope and detail. Corbucci stews up some inventive directorial flushes amongst the grit, chaos and exuberance. The atmospheric setting hit\\'s the spot and sets up many potboiler and comedic scenes. It can lull at times, and might feel somewhat overlong.  The hard-boiled story sticks to something rather stable and less than flashy, but can be thoughtful in its wide arrange of antics and tactics. It\\'s gusty political sub-text (on the treatment of the poor and use of violence to get your point across) can get a bit wishy-washy and preachy, however it definitely makes up for it in other areas like the chewy script with its constant wit and surprises.  Over-the-top entertainment equals a totally baroque and enjoyable Corbucci spaghetti western.',\n",
       " b\"This film is worth seeing simply for its monumental crapness. In the first half an hour alone countless unsympathetic characters are introduced, some of whom proceed to perform random and inexplicable actions throughout. The plot is so disjointed and badly conceived, it requires considerable effort to maintain any idea of what's going on. Not that there's any reason to do so. Instead, viewers should marvel at some appallingly bad dialogue, a staggeringly inept piece of acting from Liz Hurley, and one of the most incomprehensible plotlines I've ever come across in a film. Worth watching, simply because it is SO bad.\",\n",
       " b\"I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I was unable to stop watching until it was over, even though I sort of could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did a super job. Some of it seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, I loved it!! If you get the chance to see it, please do! I actually cried at a few scenes, but then I guess if you are a mom you would. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there, it seemed ahead of its' time. I say, WATCH IT if you can, and don't listen to criticisms. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it!\",\n",
       " b'While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end, I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D couldn\\'t keep up. It felt like a slight acid trip. Everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. But after I finish watching it, I went online to read up on the movie and I should have done a little research into this movie before watching.  The Secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story about the original Book of Kells. A small boy, Brendan, is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help \"change darkness into light.\" Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. Taking place in the 8th century, Brendan\\'s uncle, the Abbot of Kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan\\'s uncle insist he help complete the wall, but a traveler and keeper of \"the book\" secretly trains Brendan to hone in on his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete \"the book\" and carry out it\\'s word.  The entire time I watched the movie I thought I was missing something because I didn\\'t really understand what was going on. I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me all I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion of the movie greatly changed.  The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century. Along with it\\'s paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of early art form know for it\\'s intricacy, complexity, and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time, flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective. But what makes the Book of Kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it\\'s use of many colors.  The Secret of Kells is very colorful. I originally thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack which also had a flat and \"amine\" look to it. Once I learned about the art styles of the Book of Kells, it\\'s obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie. There are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan\\'s mind. Whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen. The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles. Transitions are filled with color, and Celtic knots. From the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns.  Clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits, The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. I think one has to generally be open-mined to The Secret of Kells as half art piece, half movie about history. Despite looking like it was animated with Adobe illustrator, It\\'s a very nice looking movie. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration, I don\\'t think it was worth being nominated over Mary and Max.  ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com',\n",
       " b\"The movie started out a bit promising but sank after the opening scene. Who are these people and why do we care about them? The character development was so poor that I never felt like I knew who these people were. And if I have to watch another movie with Kris Kristofferson croaking one dimensionally through another movie, I will give up watching movies. He has no no emotional range whatsoever, which considering he is a main character is a major major flaw of this movie.  The plot holes are huge. Why take the time to develop the Nanny,her realtionship to the kids, her romance and then once in America never heard or mentioned again. What happened to her? Same for Francis. All that film time and then there was no goodbye, no letters . No mention again. What happened to him?  And if we knew anything about the daughter with all the supposed development of her childhood etc, why on earth does she out of no where start sleeping with anyone who will drop his pants. And that scene where the father has the boyfriend sleep over was absolutely laughable it was so bad.  The father dies and yet there is no funeral, no goodbye, no closure: cut next scene mother getting hammered again, brother moping around depressed. Mother hoisting that diary at her son who doesn't want to read it right after the father dies. Why? Why then?  This is the problem with the whole movie. A lot of things happen but because we don't know the characters. The screenplay has so many holes we never really know anything at all. It all becomes very disjointed and by the end I was laughing it was so bad. 2 stars and please no more Kristofferson(reminds me of John Wayne and Robert Mitchem, both who couldn't act or emote either)  \",\n",
       " b\"Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Clair lost some of his charm when he went to Hollywood, but chances were good that he couldn't lose it all. I quite love his 1942 film I Married a Witch, starring Veronica Lake. I think I like this Marlene Dietrich vehicle even better. Oh, this is a charmer, all right. The plot is too complicated to describe here, but the story is very clever and very entertaining. The film is sweet, romantic and quite funny. The cast is exceptional. Bruce Cabot is surprisingly great as the leading man. You might remember him as the block of wood who won out over the monkey in King Kong. He must have gained some talent as he aged; he's much more handsome at this point, and has an effortless charm, reminiscent of Clark Gable. Roland Young plays his rival. One thing I'll always love about Golden Age Hollywood is the bevy of character actors, something we have entirely lost in the present. Here we have Mischa Auer, Anne Revere, Andy Devine, Theresa Harris and Franklin Pangborn. I had thought for sure Morocco was the best reason to own Universal's Marlene Dietrich set, but, so far, this is the best.\",\n",

       " b'Jawbreaker is *no* Heathers.  If you watch Heathers, even for the dozenth time, it\\'s amazing how easy the movie looks. Daniel Waters\\'s dialogue was a wonderful rhythm that he could never repeat. Michael Lehmann\\'s direction captured a mixture of black comedy and drama that he\\'s never been able to repeat. It could be argued that nobody in the cast (with the possible exception of Winona Ryder) has ever been better. Watching Darren Stein\\'s Jawbreaker makes you realize just how difficult it was for Waters and Lehmann to make their film, because in every way Heathers succeeds, Jawbreaker fails.  Jawbreaker has nothing new to say about high school, nor about popularity, nor about violence in society. So if you eliminate any hope of subtext, you can also wonder why exactly it doesn\\'t seem funny. Or why the finale seems random an unsatisfying. Or why there\\'s no character development at all. The dialogue isn\\'t neither as smart or as barbed as writer/director Darren Stein seems to think it is, nor is the colorful and sometimes appealingly campy direction really a redeeming feature.  The characters are all one dimensional. Rose McGowan, as Courney Alice Shayne, was given more to do in the crappy \"B\" movie Devil in the Flesh. She\\'s always watchable, but she\\'s usually more interesting. Rebecca Gayheart is supposed to be the character the audience can identify with, but her \"I remember when the dorky kids were my friends, back in fourth grade\" story arc is just ripped off poorly from Heathers. Everybody\\'s easy to look at, but none of the young actors is going to put this one prominantly on their resumes.  A string of amusing faces from the past pop up to remind you of a litany of movies that this is not. William Katt makes you yearn for Carrie. Pam Grier makes you year for a campier film like Sheba, Baby or a better film like Jackie Brown. Hell, Carol Kane even makes you yearn for the relative pleasures of a mediocre movie like The Pallbearer.  Jawbreaker isn\\'t funny. It isn\\'t original. And it isn\\'t very good. But darned if it doesn\\'t invite another viewing of Heathers. And that\\'s never bad.',\n",

       " b\"Films about identical twins are always interesting, especially when they are so gorgeous your two eyes are out on stalks looking both ways at once. Elodie Bouchez is my idea of the kind of twin I would like to have all round me, what a gal! That is the kind of double-vision we would all like to have all the time! In the story, the twins have had a hard time of it, one locked up in prison for a murder ostensibly committed at the age of 14, and the other locked up in a hideously fundamentalist Carmelite nunnery (don't you just hate all that Catholic masochism stuff?) Carmen Maura plays a mother superior who is in love with the twin who is the nun, and she is very convincing. Into this mix steps a priest named Father Joachim, played by Gerard Depardieu. He is extraordinarily good at this, despite the fact that we know in real life he is one of France's leading bon viveurs. Strangely, in this role we do not really expect him to pick up a wine bottle and drink it all in one go, or wipe his lips after having had some snails. Instead, we really believe that he is that ascetic renegade priest 'with a past'. When he gets sacked by the horrible hypocritical Monseigneur, we want to cheer because he is free of the crap and now has time to take more interest in - which twin is it? Well, there's the problem. Even he loses track of which twin it is. Each one feels the other's pain, and there is a strong paranormal element with the story, and the twins are in constant telepathic contact. This is a very intriguing and gripping tale, well made, and with the performances of Elodie Bouchez being so spell-binding (her allure is indefinable, which is what all allure should be, but it has a spiritual dimension) that this is one of those really good gripping French movies that we wish they made so many more of.\",\n",
       " b\"CRIME WAVE is a movie with much to offer. Although maybe over-titled in the sense there are only 4 criminals, it's still a solid story which is well directed, acted and photographed. This counts for a lot in 2007 as the last two movies we went out to see --- At World's End & Order of the Phoenix --- neither film had anything that could be truthfully described as a story.  A few things I really liked about CRIME WAVE: Seeing real-life World War II mega-hero STERLING HAYDEN again, as there are no real life heroes in 2007 Hollywood. I also liked seeing tough guy CHARLES BRONSON in one of his early roles. Bronson went on to become the #1 box office star in the World (although not #1 in the USA), herein playing a street punk rather than crime fighter. Beautiful Phyllis Kirk never looked better, as did LOS ANGELES; 50 years ago before 90% of their population arrived.  Now paired on DVD with Monogram Pictures' famous film noir, DECOY, that's quite a lot for a $1.50 DVD rental.\",\n",
       " b'I\\'d passed this title 15 or 20 times while in Blockbuster, looking for something halfway decent to watch. All I can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night I chose to rent this.  I will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than \"Dracula 3000\", but in actuality that\\'s pretty easy to say since this one DIDN\\'T have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialog and originality, but I suppose you can\\'t have everything.  ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find. The crew consists of: the cocky, ne\\'er-do-well captain (who dies early on), his by-the-book, yet inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a wannabe cowboy and a REALLY, REALLY butch Asian commando, \"tough guy\" female... it almost sounds like the cast for MTV\\'s \\'The Real World\\'. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) his first mate takes over... blah, blah, blah... everyone hates him... blah, blah, blah... I could go on, but as I said it\\'s the same storyline used in about a hundred other \\'films\\' of the genre.  The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course if you\\'re waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere.  I can\\'t say that it was the worst film I\\'ve seen, as I actually rented \\'Starship Troopers 2\\', but wait for this one to come on the Sci-Fi Channel.',\n",
       " b'It goes without saying that the best Myrna Loy movies have William Powell - but this movie has enough cast that it can virtually throw away Jimmy Stewart and still carry you along with the strength of the character performances. Clark \"Big Ears\" Gable is not my favorite star, but he plays the role of the loving but thoughtless husband perfectly. He believably pulls off being shrewd in business, but naive enough of his personal life to be almost innocent while looking completely guilty.   Actually, it is the pair of leading ladies that makes this movie so great - Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow. Myrna is great in everything she does - and so is Harlow. Harlow is proof that the original is nearly always the best. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Marilyn Monroe movie is simply watching second best - Harlow was the original \"blonde bombshell\" - and is still the best. Her usual forte is comedy, but she nails this light dramatic role perfectly. There are times when you don\\'t know who to cheer for - the Wife or the Secretary - and that\\'s the movie. The whole tension rides on which of these two ladies Gable chooses - or, rather, which one the audience wants him to choose. Myrna may have been the only actress who could have given Harlow a run for her money - and Harlow may have been the only one who could challenge Myrna Loy.   Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow teamed up in another movie - \"Libeled Lady\" - another tour de force of casting with William Powell and Spencer Tracy along for the ride. \"Lady\" is a very good movie; a comedy with both drawing room and slapstick elements. This type of comedy is usually more my cup of tea, but as good as \"Lady\" is, \"Wife vs. Secretary\" is better - mainly because \"Lady\" doesn\\'t let Harlow bust loose until the end of the movie.   The light touch that these two great actresses bring to \"Wife vs. Secretary\" offsets one of the fundamental conflicts and tragedies of life - that though we are often presented with two paths in life, we can only choose one - knowing that we will always wonder about the other....

       " b\"He was a revolutionary fighter, a doctor, a social philosopher and a martyr who turned to armed warfare as a 'necessary' means of stamping out the foreign complexities, poverty and injustice that had bled South America for centuries. He was a Marxist, a writer, a guerrilla and a diplomat who rose to prominence as a leader of Fidel Castro's radical '26th of July Movement': a left wing political party that launched an armed invasion of Cuba rapt on toppling U.S backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. This historical revolt: the focal point of director Steven Soderbergh's enduring, coarse and superbly crafted part one of two biopic. A sometimes bitty, sometimes brilliant hand-held epic that succeeds in its failure to fall into the consumer culture camp that's exploited Ernesto 'Che' Guevara's image now for so long.  Steven Soderbergh refrains, then, from counteracting the magnitude of Che: Part One's dense political platform by ramping up the fireworks. This wont appeal to mainstream viewers. This is not a Cuban Braveheart. This is not some twisted Scarface prequel. There will be no post-movie pop-art. Che: Part One is an intelligent and vital take on the man behind the myth not a balls-to-the-wall action spectacle blaring with blood, bullets and CGI. It's a thorough and naturalistic treatise on iconic human drive and endeavour that infrequently shuttles between monochrome and Technicolor, between Che Guevara's 1964 delegation at the UN headquarters and time spent trudging through the Cuban jungle.  If your understanding of certain political ideals and movements are, at best, hazy- then it's best to steer clear of this one. You're likely are likely to find the first serving of Soderbergh's four-and-a-half-hour, two part political epic a little confusing. This ain't no Hollywood funded, slick and stylish, over-dramatic chronicle concerned with entertainment or income. This isn't 'Defiance' or 'Valkrye'. This is a well-researched, claustrophobic and paced political drama (shot in Spanish) where spurts of action, violence and humour are few and far between. Imagine Oliver Stone's 'Salvador' by the way of Terrance Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line': fragmented, anti-mainstream and very heavy-going.  The bravura Benicio Del Toro stars as Che and is quite excellent. He delivers a focused and unwavering performance worthy of a thousand accolades: his finest since '21 Grams'. The fact that Del Toro is fluent in Spanish also helps, as does a rallying and unknown supporting cast that work well as a low-key ensemble. It's all about Del Toro, though. His insurgent, intense and convincing Che is one marred by crippling bouts of asthma yet defined by a burning desire to educate and reform- to put his litigious beliefs into action and unite Latin America.  With Che: Part One, the diligent Steven Soderbergh has found his blend of realism and narrative, documentary and drama. As an avid Che fan and reader of his books and biographies, there is little doubt in my mind that this monumental work will stand as the first piece in the definitive two part screen portrait of one the twentieth century's most iconic, yet largely uncharted, political figures.  Final Verdict: While lesser films wallow in the limelight, Che: Part One stirs understated in the shadows seemingly content with the fact that it wont appeal to all, or many. Steven Soderbergh has crafted a very loyal and well-made biopic. One that demythologises, one that educates, one that excels and ensues Walter Salle's soul-searching Che preface: The Motorcycle Diaries.\",\n",
       " b\"this film, at least as far as the DVD jacket is concerned, is portrayed as an action movie about the changes that take place in soldiers seeing combat. Until the battle scene is over and you realize that the focus is instead going to be on their post-combat return to civilian life, you are expecting something unique and insightful. This movie is so clich\\xc3\\xa9' ridden as to be laughable, from the conceit of a short-timer squad going out on one last patrol (yeah, yeah, the same as every 19 year on-the-job cop movie where the sergeant dies the day before retirement, yawn), to the PTSD laden troubles that have been shown over and over in so many movies, so much better, in the past 30 years. I'm truly embarrassed for Samuel Jackson. I would have thought he would have had much better sense in selecting a script. He does great. Can he not? But THIS film? I'm 3/4 the way through and still waiting for just a hint of something original that I have not seen before (employment woes, civilian misconceptions, drug and alcohol abuse, slams against the VA -yawn). And don't get me started on offering a role to an overpaid gangster like fiddy cent to try and lure viewers instead of spending the money on talented writers.

It has a totally lame cast, with Roman Danylo constantly over-acting his parts, and making up REALLY stupid characters for which to do his sketches. The girls on the show, quite frankly, have no comedic talent. They are just horrible at impressions, for those of you who have seen the judge Judy skit, you know what I'm talking about. Also, it is a Canadian show, so why do they try and tackle so many American issues? Americans do not want to see a bunch of no talent Canadians making American jokes, just as Canadians don't want to see a bunch of slack jawed Americans making Canadian jokes. It just doesn't flow. Anybody thinking of watching this show, you might as well take a fork and jab yourself in the eye, that would be a lot more entertaining then watching this dreg.

Lots of slapstick: Buster falling on a bulkhead door, falling in a puddle, running around pants-less. Silly scientist\\'s invention of a Time Helmet, reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of what the future would be. Cheap prices, like $1.95 for ladies hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster/Mulligan. How shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the \"modern\" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go backwards! The \"scientist\" of that time wants to return to a calmer world, the 1890 that he has studied and admired. They go back together, and Buster/Mulligan is now happy and the \"scientist\" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet.  This Twilight Zone doesn\\'t have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last efforts. That\\'s enough.

I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie. Then after some milk throwing, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. Duh. Then while she is making it with him, her son gets stung by wasps.

The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually, the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes the part that just doesn\\'t ring true.

Yes, Bernie Mac was relentless in his bullying but Ashton rarely stood up for himself and when he did, he just spoke out of the side of his mouth ....mumbling. It was just painful to watch.

The big shock was that *I* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqu\\xc3\\xa9 like in Shrek [\"do you think he\\'s compensating for something?\"]).  A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. I\\'d like my kids to think that there\\'s more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.  Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action but nothing too scary (the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one...)  All in all I\\'d say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that\\'s 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I\\'ve had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you\\'re safe to leave the room during this one. I\\'d say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)',\n",

It is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated, now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me. Though, if you are a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic(sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world(hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet's the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.\",\n",
       " b'Often considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock\\'s lesser known films, \"Stage Fright\" has unfortunately gotten a bad wrap. Even mediocre Hitchcock is better than most movies ever get, though. And this one is a solid, entertaining picture. With an eclectic cast one doesn\\'t expect to see together, each diverse actor provides a little something for everyone. And with Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Todd and Michael Wilding how can you go wrong?  Wyman convincingly plays a drama student who gets involved over her head in a purely Hitchcockian case of murder. When her ex-lover Todd is suspected of killing Dietrich\\'s husband, Wyman hides him and helps him allude the police. Meanwhile, Wyman disguises herself as Dietrich\\'s maid to help find evidence to save Todd\\'s freedom. Wyman falls into a dangerous trap, and danger surrounds her.  Disappointingly underdeveloped as it starts, \"Stage Fright\" eventually turns into a first-rate thriller. While Wyman has been better, Dietrich is hilariously catty and Todd is wickedly suspicious. This is undoubtedly a Hitchcock film all the way around, but adding a nice twist to the formula is a soaring, romantic soundtrack. A seriously satisfying film, \"Stage Fright\" hits most of the right notes.',\n",
       " b\"How this movie could have been left out of the top 100 flicks of all time I will never know. I remember Keaton as a grumpy old man in the cinema of the 50's and 60's. It was only later when in college film school that I recogized his true genius. The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium. It had everything, drama, comedy, action, romance. It was also pretty much true to the real event also. My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit. His girlfriend having run out of wood to stoke the engine hands him a twig. Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her. The other thing that I love about the movie is that there is not one second of wasted film, every scene has definite purpose and it holds your attention every minute. This is Keaton's masterpiece always.\",\n",

In addition to the usual supposedly funny situations that routinely happen in one of these \"comedians loose in a harem\" type movies, A&C manage to add more drivel. EXAMPLE: There are two really stupid scenes that take place in different jail cells where they encounter an obnoxious looney-bin character who actually reprises the tired and old \"Niagra Falls, slowly I turned\" routine. And, since this is an A&C picture, the bit, unfunny to start with, is naturally overdone. The second jailhouse scene with the fruitcake lasts about 15 minutes, which is about 14 minutes too long. What makes it worse is that the scene seems to last for an hour. I admit that I never cared for A&C but, it many of their films, I could find a couple of laughs. But, for me, there were no laughs in this turkey. Just, tired old routines that contributed to the boredom factor.',\n",
       " b'Lovely concert singer Isabel Lewis (Evelyn Ankers) is engaged to marry medical student Ted Allison (David Bruce.) When she unexpectedly falls in love with her pianist Eric Iverson (a very suave Turhan Bey), she turns to Ted\\'s laboratory boss Dr. Morris (George Zucco.) But it happens that Dr. Morris is in love with Isabel himself, and he decides to get rid of his assistant by subjecting him to ancient Mayan gas! Unfortunately for Ted, this gas is of a particularly nasty sort: it transforms him into a zombie-like creature. Under the control of Dr. Morris, Ted then participates in gathering the human hearts he must have for injections that allow him to return, temporarily, to normal.  The idea for this story seems to arise from a number of sources, most particularly the silent classic THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, the various versions of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, and THE RETURN OF DR. X--the latter a particularly peculiar B-flick featuring an unexpected Humphrey Bogart as a lab-created vampire of sorts. It other hands, the concept might have worked quite well, but although the cast is accomplished and the production values are generally quite good, the make-up effects are hardly up to the Universal standard, the pace is slow, and the script is quite dire.  The film makes no effort to create any sort of \"transformation\" when actor David Bruce goes from golly-gee lab assistant to shambling zombie; it is a straight cut-away, cut-back-to shot, and the latter finds him in uninspired make-up and with very untidy hair. Director James P. Hogan maintains a pace every bit as leaden-footed as the zombie, and as for the script... well, it is probably this sort of script that Evelyn Ankers, the studio\\'s \"Scream Queen\" of the 1940s, had in mind when she walked away from Universal a year later. Given the talents of the cast and the overall look of the film, which (make-up effects aside) is handsomely mounted, I find it difficult to give this film less than three stars. All the same, I greatly doubt that THE MAD GHOUL will have any appeal for those outside the circle die-hard Universal horror fans.  GFT, Amazon Reviewer',\n",
       " b\"I liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem I quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).  There is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).  Admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.\",\n",

Neat idea, but not put together well. If you're bored, and there is nothing else to watch, you might make it through it. Like everyone says, last 10 minutes are little gory, not really anything else 'bloody' in the movie (unless you count those nasty boils on his back :P)I too have seen the original Freaks, and I would not even compare them because...well...you just can't...the original was a cult classic, this one is no where near that.

       " b'Dark City is the best film of Alex Proyas. He uses the Gothic and claustrophobic themes commonly and dark colors prevail during the film like \"The Crow\" .The story doesn\\'t follow a certain order of rule, instead there is some mind games and puzzles in the film, that causes watchers to be active in each minute and motivate to the movie..  The topic is about a man who loses his past and first finds himself in a bath tub, doesn^t know about himself and his life, but he has one ability that no one has, he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand. The story is so fantastic and Proyas\\' nightmare world come true in that movie.  I can basically say that it\\'s one of the best science fiction movies ever made, it opens doors to different dimensions and force human brains\\' capability....  \"Mutlu Bahar\"',\n",
       " b'\"With Friends Like These\" is a gem of a movie waiting to be discovered by millions of people who are intelligent, love comedies, and have a deep feeling for the human condition -- especially as it involves competition among friends for fame and fortune. While the friends in this movie are \"bit actors\" operating within the \"Hollywood\"/cinematic context, the forces that move them -- and us, as viewers -- are universal, and could apply to any group of friends, in any situation. The premise of the movie is simple, and like many things simple, it derives from a brilliant observation: friends will be disloyal to one another if they sense the rewards of disloyalty are great enough. On the face of it, the rewards seem obvious--money and adulation--but the desire for them itself reflects the true motivation of the actor-friends: desire for simple recognition of their talent in a system that chronically ignores and demeans them as human beings, artists, and professionals and -- at best -- underutilizes what they have to offer both film-makers and audiences. In a word, they are frustrated . . . to the point of desperation. And the thought of auditioning for Martin Scorcese himself -- in a new mob movie he is casting -- is irresistible. Worth anything, in fact -- even the risk of losing the love and respect of their dearest friends. Given this powerful motivator, the \"secret\" about the Scorcese audition initially held by one of the friends is soon let loose, and rapidly spreads among the others like an infectious disease . . . thus creating the competitive situation that fuels the film. Unlike most comedies today, however --which pathetically attempt to garner laughs from the audience through the characters\\' mindless \"schtick,\" pratfalls, and mean-spirited jabs at one other -- the humor in \"With Friends Like These\" derives organically from the situation the characters find themselves in, aided by their idiosyncratic personalities. Even the situation, itself, however, and the types of characters who inhabit it, would not produce the guffaws, chuckles, and deep smiles that \"Friends\" does, were it not for the intimate knowledge of the movie industry and actors that Phil Messina, the writer-director, brings to every frame. \"With Friends Like These\" is much more than a comedy: It is a perceptive depiction of the \"human condition\" in a modern, capitalist society,conveyed in a humorous, humanistic way. For these reasons, \"With Friends Like These\" -- like the exceptional films of Woody Allen -- is a rare gem that should not be missed by anyone who loves great movies.',\n",
       " b\"I totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode. The acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest. The only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????\",\n",
       " b'I\\'ve never seen such twaddle written about a film as I have in reviews of \"Let It Be.\" Please, throw out everything you have heard about it and just see it. If you like good music, you will be glad you did.  The film is a chronicle of The Beatles\\' recording session for their \"Let It Be\" album. There is no phony storyline, it is cinema verite of a fairly straightforward recording session (by the premier band ever, with all the trappings). And yes, the band did break up down the road, eventually, and for that matter John got shot and George died of cancer. But, no, this session is not \"sad\" and does not show \"the breakup.\" That is all 20-20 hindsight related to the fact that the group finally did break up around the time the film was released. In fact, the boys, obviously after a lengthy layoff, gradually get back into things over the course of the film and by the end of the creative process are once more musical dynamite.  Perhaps you have been on a sports team, or in a drama production, or some other group endeavor in school. You reach a fine pitch of performance at the end of the year, then break for summer. You come back the next year and, rusty and out of practice, just don\\'t have the same teamwork as you did at the end of the previous year. There are petty squabbles and lots of sour notes amid traces of the brilliance that once was. But you work and work and work through the year, and finally get it all back. That is EXACTLY what this film is about. Paul is like the coach who is up to speed while the players are all out of shape, but he pushes and prods to get them up to speed. In the end, they are all back in rhythm together again.  There are some fascinating vignettes that I have to point out. This film established Yoko in the public mind as a kind of Satanic figure. She sits in the corner, never smiling, almost frowning whenever John looks like he\\'s having fun. As a public relations effort, it was a disaster for her. Since Paul was behind the film, that kind of makes you think a bit....  Another fascinating aspect is the reaction of the locals to the rooftop concert. You had staid banker types, pipes clenched in teeth, climbing on rooftops to get a good look and listen. Others, in the street, mumbled about how the boys were \"good people.\" The crowd is almost reverent in its expressions. You don\\'t get THAT kind of reaction too often to a performance. The Beatles reached right across generational lines, to the old as much as to the young. No, that is not too common nowadays, either.  The high point of this film begins not at the famous rooftop concert, but right before it. Back-to-back, out of nowhere after all the fumbling rehearsals, suddenly we get two perfect, crystal-clear music videos of Paul singing \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" (better than the released versions imho). George and John are grinning as they add the background vocals, Ringo taking the occasional drag on a cigarette. Then, having satisfied themselves that they have recaptured the magic, the boys emerge from their bunker onto the Apple Corps rooftop to shout to the world, \"We\\'re back and better than ever!\" There also is an element of the renegade in this coming out party, with John at last showing the liveliness for which he was famous as the group rather audaciously decides to wake the old town up. What garage band hasn\\'t wanted to just climb on the roof and let it rip? Every single one of them was having a blast, maybe Paul in particular because finally the others had caught up to him and were making the contributions to the effort for which he had been waiting.  The final song, \"Get Back,\" is simply brilliant. Sung by Paul while the cops were waiting patiently to, what, arrest them? He spits out lines like \"she\\'s gonna have you ARRESTED\" like a madman while everybody looks over their shoulders at the men in black helmets. Sure, it was all staged, but so what? If that isn\\'t one of the coolest scenes in film, I don\\'t know what is. Check out the ending of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (those guys were HUGE Beatles fans) to see a send-up of this ending.  You still want to insist that the film \"shows the breakup of the Beatles\"? Uh, no, I don\\'t think so. \"Abbey Road,\" which came after this and was the culmination of the Beatles legend, put the lie to that forever. If you really pay attention, this film instead shows The Beatles at their essence, brilliance with the genius touch of the renegade. Just musicians, doing their thing better than anyone else.',\n",
       " b'\"Imagine That\" is by my humbly opinion one of the best Movies i watched this year. After all daily stress that we have in everyday\\'s surrounding this movie truly made my evening. For the 1h and 45 minutes that it took it truly filed me with enough positive energy and relaxation.  Yara Shahidi with Eddie Murphy done a great job in this movie.

I recommend it to everyone. Don\\'t miss it!!!',\n",
       " b'Clerks is one of those movies everyone knows everything about even before they\\'ve seen it. The most fascinating aspect is probably the back-story: Kevin Smith sold his comic-book collection to finance it, shot it in the convenience store where he was working at the time, and cast his school friends in the various roles (two of them wound up playing three or four characters each). The film became a huge hit at Sundance, and is now widely (and justly) considered one of the best independent movies of all time.  The plot is quite easy to sum up: nothing happens. It\\'s just a \"regular\" day in the lives of a few people working in or outside a Quick Stop convenience store. The fun starts immediately, as Dante Hicks (Brian O\\'Halloran) is asked to replace a sick colleague. This upsets him a lot, since it\\'s supposed to be his day off (\"You know what the worst part is? I\\'m not even supposed to BE here today!\"). So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who \"works\" in the video store next to Quick Stop. Together, they discuss things like hermaphroditic porn or, Tarantino-style, which Star Wars sequel is better (Jedi or Empire?), and also try to find ways of not working, or at least make the day less boring (as Randal puts it:\"This job would be great if it wasn\\'t for the f**king customers\"). Between these discussions, they also interact with Dante\\'s present girlfriend Veronica (whose sex life causes heated debates) and ex Caitlin, who\\'s apparently engaged to some Asian design major. And let\\'s not forget Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself), two drug dealers consistently located outside the store.  Smith uses these characters to reference his favorite movies (the previously mentioned Star Wars, as well as Jaws and Indiana Jones) and talk about any subject in the filthiest way imaginable. Some incredibly outrageous stuff is mentioned (\"jizz moppers\", necrophilia, \"snowballing\"), but unlike John Waters, he never shows the events discussed by Dante, Randal et al. Everything occurs, or has occurred, off-screen, so all we get to do is have a good laugh, because no matter how crude it gets (the film is rated R for \"Extensive Use Of Extremely Explicit Sex-Related Dialogue\"), Smith\\'s writing remains genuinely funny. Randal, in particular, steals every scene with his existential musings (\"I\\'m a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.\") or very politically incorrect antics (the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby).  If you haven\\'t seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status. It has priceless dialogue, wisecracking characters and loads of swearing. What else can you ask for?',\n",
       " b'for the most part, On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already have an opinion on. It was either this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I haven\\'t seen, and I was actually in a movie watching mood, which doesn\\'t happen often anymore because I\\'ve already watched all the movies i own a million times, and that\\'s a lot of movies, and I don\\'t have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret it. I\\'m not going to put in any spoilers, I\\'m just going to tell you that only a FEW of the very FEW actors in this movie ,are half way decent. I think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying looking, but convincing; I\\'d take her for psycho bitch anyday, so she fits her roll well, though it is lame. The blood isn\\'t that great, only a few of the kills, or may I say \"woundings\" are alright, but you don\\'t see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. Towards the end of the movie I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a band member, the \\'recording\\' parts weren\\'t very interesting either, though what happened would truly happen when going about recording. I\\'m done, if you want to watch this, suit yourself.',\n",
       " b\"I am more and more disappointed by the quality of 'independent films' that appear ever more often on Sundance Channel (where I saw this film), and IFC, and with the honesty of reviews found on this website.  As far as Sundance and IFC go - I simply have to assume that ever since the 'independent' genre made it big, finding quality programming that draws an audience without having to pay great sums must be becoming increasingly difficult.  As far as the reviews on this website go I feel that films, especially small films like this, are reviewed favorably primarily because of shills. Maybe they are friends of the filmmaker, and family members, etc. And you know, if I were a filmmaker, I would certainly enlist those I know to do the same.  The truth is this film is pretty bad, and pretty unwatchable, and if I cast my mom and dad in a movie (and they are in many ways like the couple in the film), my film would undoubtedly be pretty bad too. But you see - I would never take my home movies to Sundance, and pitch them shamelessly to further my career (or lack thereof).  I feel sorry for Andrew's parents - who probably just want to see their son succeed in this business - but their acting was awful - although 'realistic', to be sure.  In fact the 'professional actors (there are very few people in reality who are)' in this film, oddly, seemed 'more real' than the director/writer's real parents. But somehow at some level I think that the director may have chosen his parents as his 'human shield' against criticism of this film.  But it's not just bad acting, it's bad editing, and I guess, my inability to suspend disbelief at everything happening in this film that ruins this film.  The bottom line - a bad film that ends up, inexplicably on Sundance, because it probably cost them little to nothing to get it, and well, the director gets the visibility.  Someone needs to set this film straight for other users.\",\n",
       " b\"A French army regiment, resplendent in colorful uniform, is quartered in a French provincial town for summer exercises. As this detachment first enters the town marching in order down its main thoroughfare, a beautiful woman (Michele Morgan) appears on the balcony of her fashion shop and catches the eye of the regiment's dashing and handsome Lothario who has already compiled a notorious string of conquests (Gerard Philipe). This gives rise to a bet by his fellow soldiers with him, when the soldiers reach their barracks, that this time he will not be able to seduce this woman. He launches a spirited campaign for her, designed to sweep her off her feet, but becomes so ensnared in her charms that he completely loses his mind and falls genuinely and madly in love with her, forgetting totally about the bet and wanting only her. The high point of his fortunes is reached when, practically on bended knee, he protests to her that he does not love her for only a few days or a few weeks but for his whole life. She is on the point of yielding to his entreaties when she learns of the bet. The denouement is exquisite torture as she is unable to credit his protestations any longer notwithstanding that she passionately desires to, he is in effect impaled to his hurt on the thorns of his past, she ends by returning to the fat husband with greasy ringlets of curls from whom she'd been divorced and who appears totally unworthy of her, and the regiment marches out of town at the end of summer. There are comic interludes of great charm and even some hilarity, as well as all the brilliance and wit that make a French movie a French movie, but all in all this is a sentimentalist's dream of a production in which the adorable loveliness of Michele Morgan is at its dazzling height.\",\n",
       " b'Yes, the two leads are rather dull and the complete breakdown of society in about 48 hours, while explained by a few throwaway lines of dialog is a little hard to swallow. Still, Dragon Head is a success. A story where 2 high school kids emerge from what they think was an underground train wreck to find a natural disaster has decimated the entire countryside. Their immediate goal is to get to their homes in Tokyo. Along the way, the encounter the dregs of what remains of the populace, escaping death several times. The two youngsters also learn, that despite losing everything, in this new world, having each other is their most important possession.

       " b\"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie was my first touch with Mr Sica so I really didn't know what to expect. But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way.  The storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy- orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses. This little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine. But one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place. But as the title of the movie hints - there is a miracle taking place. Our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother. What is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well?  It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy. There is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people. Also many funny moments and scenes are included - at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more.  So according to the fact that I m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because I liked it much   I\",\n",

       " b\"Being fully dependent to technology is a weakness. That's what Dutch and the predator learned. At the beginning, the human team made mistakes that cost many lives. Leaving all the human-made weapons and becoming one with the Nature wasn't a choice, it was an evidence.It was a better idea to focus on efficient use of raw materials than wasting time with predictable guns. Once Dutch understood the trick, the predator began to reproduce these mistakes. Dutch became invisible and the predator tried to blast everywhere as if he was blind by his confidence on his technology. To sum up my ideas : Nature vs Technology, Unconsciousness vs Rationality, Confidence vs Fear. To conclude, i would say that Dutch finally reached his distant ancestors' primal instincts for hunting and survival that made the human race competitive on the natural selection. As my title said, Dutch has gone back to the basics.\",\n",
       " b'Stars: The Beatles as themselves and various characters.  I have no idea what the Beatles were thinking when they made this, and I\\'m sure neither did they. \"Magical Mystery Tour\" has the loose story of a group of people on an English tour bus that\\'s out of the ordinary. Strange things happen on this bus, like random music videos and really random dreams of food and love. I guess making this movie was a way to show off some of the Beatles\\' songs, but I would\\'ve much preferred the music videos to sitting watching this. It makes too little sense for it\\'s own good. The reason this deserves a 3, is because I did enjoy some of the songs (which were spread out, making us wait through nonsensical sub-plots), and even though it was totally random, some of the daydreams amused me. The I am the Walrus segment of this is so strange, with an already out there song, now made in to a music video where they were walrus heads and cut to random fires and John Lennon dressed as the egg man. One of the main positives for this, is it is short, running at only around an hour, so you don\\'t have to sit through much. I\\'d really only recommend this to Beatles\\' fans, or for people that want to really experience a bad acid trip. For me, this is much worse than the already lacking Yellow Submarine film, and is almost unwatchable.  My rating: * 1/2 out of ****.',\n",

       " b'That magical moment in life, that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood, and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about.   Danni (wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon) is right at that moment in life when the movie starts. She swoons over Elvis, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love. Maureen her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn\\'t. She dates a local loser whos father is also after her, and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet. Danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn\\'t good enough. She wants to be Maureen but doesn\\'t see that she is beautiful herself.  The moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets Court Foster for the first time. Court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers. He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun. On one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find Danni skinny dipping. They yell and argue and Danni leaves. But they see each other a day later when Courts mother is invited to Danni\\'s to visit old friends(Danni\\'s Parents). Danni becomes attracted to Court, and Court to Danni. She is a tomboy and is spunky, has attitude and says whats on her mind.   Court is 17 and Danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between Court working the farm. By the time Court kisses her one day, Danni is smitten. Danni\\'s father tells her to invite Court to the house and he does. but things are uncomfortable for Court on his \"sort of date\". The silence though is broken by his meeting with Maureen who has yet to see Court. One look between the two and its all over. The looks of pain and defeat on Danni\\'s face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time. The rest of the movie I will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters.  The greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love, and the pain they must endure both together and individually. Danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair, painful, and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started. Few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly. This movie has since the first time I watched it stuck in my mind. Its in the my Top 100 movie list and deservedly so. I only wish more movies like this were made, because if so . . . my faith in Hollywood would be a lot better.',\n",

       " b\"This is a bad movie. The real story of the Entebbe rescue was much more exciting and interesting than this. Everything about the movie, apart from the star-studded cast, screams low-budget. But even the stars can't save this movie: Kirk Douglas and Liz Taylor overact horribly. So does the guy who plays Idi Amin, but I suspect Amin was even worse in real life so I'll cut him some slack. Anthony Hopkins and Richard Dreyfuss perform well, though. The woman who plays the female German terrorist is a caricature of a Nazi. The characterization is paper-thin, though that is perhaps understandable given the number of characters. A lot of the dialogue is awful, a part near the beginning where Linda Blair is having an insipid conversation with her new beaux actually made me laugh out loud. The effort to humanize the male German terrorist was silly and pointless. I haven't seen the other two movies about Entebbe, but don't watch this one. Read a book about it instead.\",\n",
       " b'What could be described as a milestone of football (soccer) movies, well, it had the worst sequel a movie can have.  Goal II: Living The Dream follows Santiago, but, this time, he transfers to Real Madrid. And now, I even wonder if it was the club owners who produced the film, because this is advertising as its best.  Raul, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, yeah go figure, all those stars happen to play themselves in the film. And why the hell do I care? Awful movie. At least Goal I had a fantastic an original story, nevermind adding that it was set on England, the birthplace of football.  As a movie, it is done as good as the first one. But the plot ruins it.',\n",
       " b\"First off, I dislike almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something about this that is unique, that draws me in, and I would say it is among the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers?   Ah, afraid they might sue, so he changed them into men. And how dull would it be if they were only housewives, show biz stars is more fun. Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at age 97 (she even outlived Walter Matthau's magnificent impersonation of her!)would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters.  Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances I can recall (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it, although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character).  Very ethnic in flavor, and over the top, you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off. For me, the pleasure lingers.\",\n",
       " b\"This sort of thing has been done many times before with bees,slugs,rats and even ticks so why not a creature feature with locusts. This is a made for TV feature starring one time butt kicking warrior princess Lucy Lawless. A swarm of genetically engineered locusts escape from a laboratory and head across America creating a swathe of destruction as they go. This may have been an interesting idea on the drawing board but it has one big problem, the locusts just don't feel threatening.In classic films such as The Birds and The Swarm you feel threatened by the creatures but in this the locusts are more likely to induce a yawn rather than any sense of panic or terror.Half way through the feature the locusts turn carnivorous and this gave me the feeling that ideas had started to run out. I know Lucy Lawless may be trying to move away from Xena but surely she could choose better vehicles for her talent than this half baked attempt at creature feature terror. The dialogue was forced, the direction was slow and probably because the locusts were CGI based they didn't even begin to bring me out in even a Luke warm sweat. I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score. My advice to anyone out there is to avoid this feature at all costs.\",\n",
       " b'I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline-esque commercials, but thought I\\'d give it a chance. So I\\'ve watched it, and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It\\'s rare that I hate a movie this much. Watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman\\'s \"The Player,\" when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers. I\\'d like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of Bronte (but this time Heathcliff\\'s name is Heath and he\\'s a rock star, and Hindley\\'s name is Hendrix) would be a good idea.  Even that might not have been so bad, had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well. The direction must have been \"you\\'re lonely, pout for me.\" I laughed out loud during all the \"serious\" scenes and was bored throughout the rest. The camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy. My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom -- all I could hear in half the scenes were the waves. And in the other scenes, I wish that\\'s all I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did to the Sisters of Mercy song \"More\" is absolutely inexcusable, then again, it\\'s inexcusable what they did to Bronte.  On the bright side, there was one entertaining scene -- specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl\\'s face -- and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you.',\n",
       " b'Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were \"so bad it\\'s good,\" but it\\'s not. It\\'s just dull, lifeless, and boring. It\\'s so bad I couldn\\'t even laugh at it.  In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement on vanity, cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother.  The gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy, and can act. Although you can tell she\\'s holding back.  All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supporting male, Mark. I\\'ve seen less wood in a rain forest, but he\\'s still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn\\'t one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo, it\\'s how I felt after watching his movie.  Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out, you\\'ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks).',\n",
       " b'As Keystone comedies go, this is a pretty dark and depressing little piece of work. There\\'s an amusing moment or two along the way, thanks largely to Roscoe Arbuckle\\'s physical dexterity, but the story is more harrowing than funny, with an ending that\\'s like something out of Kafka. And if you know the details of Arbuckle\\'s tragic life and career the distressing impact of FATTY JOINS THE FORCE is only compounded.  The story gets under way in a park. Fatty and his wife encounter cop Edgar Kennedy, who apparently tosses off a sassy remark (about Roscoe\\'s girth?) en route to a flirtation with a nursemaid. While the cop and the maid are chatting, the nurse\\'s charge, a little girl, wanders off and then falls into the lake. Fatty comes to the rescue and saves the little girl, who turns out to be the Police Commissioner\\'s daughter. Fatty the hero is \\'rewarded\\' with a position on the police force, but quickly gets into trouble. He falls afoul of a group of teenage boys who easily get the better of him. By the end, due to a misunderstanding, the one-time hero is mistaken for a dangerous \"wild man,\" and winds up in jail himself, disgraced and sobbing with frustration while his wife flirts with the Police Commissioner.  How funny does that sound? . . . Not so funny, right? And when you consider that Arbuckle himself plummeted from a position of wealth and celebrity to genuine and lasting disgrace, due, according to the most credible research, to a tragic misunderstanding, the weepy close-up of Roscoe in his jail cell that concludes this film is even more disturbing than it might otherwise be. History buffs will be reminded of the infamous composite photo that ran in the Hearst papers at the height of the Arbuckle scandal in 1921, showing a grim-faced Roscoe supposedly behind bars in San Francisco, facing rape and manslaughter charges. (The charges were real, all right, but the photo was faked.) Even taken on its own terms, FATTY JOINS THE FORCE is short on laughs. Roscoe executes a couple of funny falls, and reacts strenuously to a pie in the face, but otherwise this movie is about as comical as Hitchcock\\'s THE WRONG MAN.',\n",
       " b'What a sad flop, with the best of intentions. The message to the viewer is overly clear, it shouts: this is an artistic, slow and sensuous movie, contrasting Oriental philosophy with Western greed for speed and immediate effects. Well, yes, we get this rather soon, and then we suffer through the rest\\xc2\\x85 Perhaps slow movies are not exact equivalents of slow food, after all.   There are some redemptive traits, though. The film could be see as an illustration of Joyce Carol Oates\\'s observation that \"prolonged happiness is a prison from which the self yearns to escape at any cost\". People cannot stand a prolonged happiness, and the protagonist says so much himself.   Another (attempt at) redemption: perhaps the movie is about the temptations of Orientalism typical for the era portrayed: the Western men, bored to tears, looking for any kind of adventure that the exotic Orient could offer them. Because if it is a love story, it is H\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa8ne\\'s love story, but if so, it is underdeveloped. The other \"love story\" is too ridiculous even to consider.  Finally: it is true that seeing it in with a full screen can help; I have watched it as DVD, and although it was a very good screen, it could not reproduce the immersion effect possible on a large screen only.',\n",
       " b'There was a certain kind of picture in the \"pre-code\" era, in which the licentiousness of the times would throw up any kind of strange fantasy. In the most significant period of sexual liberation before the 1960s, and still in an era where plucking a bride from a primitive culture did not seem a bit dodgy, a picture like Bird of Paradise could exist. A yarn like this would be the stuff of corny B-flicks a few decades later, but back in 1932 it was acceptable A-feature material.  So what we have here is a rather odd dichotomy. A daft storyline, yet one pulled off with panache. The producer and director is King Vidor, one of the most uniquely talented filmmakers of all time, and what\\'s more he appears to have taken Bird of Paradise very seriously. His camera set-ups give an almost documentary feel to the proceedings. He doesn\\'t force us in with point-of-view shots, or make us coldly objective, but often has us peeping over shoulders or from behind props, like an extra amid the action. This not only gives us the feeling of being there, it is also incredibly vivid and dynamic. He directs with a mixture of realism (most of the extras were genuine Polynesians) and bizarre stylisation, culminating in rituals which become macabre and frenzied riots.  Bird of Paradise also includes a couple of \"before they were famous\" curios. Those wild tribal dances are choreographed by Busby Berkeley. His stark, abstract formations are already evident, and nicely suit the feel of this picture. Then there is music by Max Steiner, composing what happens to be one of the earliest examples of an orchestral backing score in a talking picture. Steiner\\'s score is a little awkward in its mixing, but melodically it is fine, establishing themes for different characters, setting tones, matching action but never once threatening to upstage the images. Berkeley and Steiner would soon take up residence at Warner Brothers, and the rest would be history. Oh, and there\\'s one more curio, in that you several times clearly hear the Hawaiian word \"wiki\", nearly seventy years before anyone thought of joining it to \"pedia\".  The cast of Bird of Paradise are a rather odd bunch, but it doesn\\'t seem to matter. The ship\\'s crew members are filled out with a number of comedy supporting players, like \\'Skeets\\' Gallagher and Bert Roach. They make the onboard scenes a little more interesting, but their appearances are fleeting and their performances muted enough that they never threaten to overbalance the picture or make it too farcical. Lead man Joel McCrea was a competent rather than an exceptional actor, but he has the ideal physique and manner for the character. Importantly he is also a generous player, who never attempts to steal the scene. And finally we have Dolores del Rio, of course looking far more Hispanic than Polynesian, but nevertheless convincing as a native woman, and certainly vivacious.  In spite of, or perhaps because of the talkies being firmly established and no longer stilted, Bird of Paradise seems more than anything like a silent picture. It does not make do without dialogue, but what dialogue there is tends to be superfluous, the images speaking eloquently enough. In other words, you could have released it as a silent, and not needed many title cards. With its mystical, exotic tone we do not really need to hear the actors rabbiting on to retain a sense of naturalism. And yes, it does contain many moments that are somewhat laughable (such as Joel McCrea riding a turtle like it was a surfboard), but thanks to its inventive direction, spot-on casting, and professional production it manages, against all odds, to salvage some dignity.',\n",
       " b'Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. This is a horrible film in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive a D for this. College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school. Since this monstrosity was made by \"Professionals\" I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. I enjoy watching bad movies Like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" but, this thing doesn\\'t even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970\\'s horror films.

WTH?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock? 100+? These people fire their guns without the need of reloading). The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can't save this junk.  DO not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one). Hopefully the director would either stop making movies, or learn more for his next movie.\",\n",

It's not singleminded and not disperse. It's not totally plot driven nor does it dwell on deep psychological insights about the characters. It's better than a typical American romantic comedy. You know, it's not Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks again. It's more real life-ish, more emotional, less superficial and yet just as fun. It's the kind of movie where you want to make sure you have your bucket of popcorn, your soda and a comfortable place to sit. And yeah, it's the kind of movie that makes you leave the theatre feeling just a bit happier on the whole. :)\",\n",

I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for some years, so I had the chance to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg. Scary Movie, loads of Scifi spoofs etc.) but this one is the best one of that kind, I've seen so far. I give a 9 of 10. The only reason I can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the DVD, so there's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand.\",\n",

I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut maybe I'll check it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is s*** and the worst kind of s***. Maybe if the film had some T&A that would've have made it okay. But the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma film.\",\n",
       " b\"Troll 2 makes Troll 1 look like Citizen Kane. In other words it's bad. Really bad. This movie is so bad that after watching it you'll want to run out and rent Ghoulies to get the taste out of your mouth.  The opening scene has trolls chasing someone through a misty field to the tune of 80's techno music and it only gets better after that.  *********I'm ashamed to say this about such a stupid movie, but this review contains SPOILERS******************   The movie involves a family moving to a town named Nilbog (that's right it's goblin spelled backwards even though the movie is called Troll, not Goblin) and swapping houses with some hillbillies. When watching this movie it's best if you go into it prepared to not ask any questions. Why a family would move into another family's furnished, food-stocked house is better left unexplained. Also why a family would proceed to eat the other family's green icing covered dinner is also better just accepted as normal.  The green icing on the food is a repetitive theme throughout the uhhh...film. It's apparently some sort of troll dna juice that turns the digester into a troll. Although that is never really explained. Another tool the clever goblins..err trolls have come up with is Nilbog milk which also turns the person who drinks it into a troll. If it's that easy, it seems like they could turn the entire world into trolls by mass producing Nilbog milk, but maybe that's not their intention. What the trolls get from turning other people into trolls is never explained like in so many monster takeover movies. The monsters/zombies/trolls/aliens always want to turn humans into their likeness and that's universally accepted, but why? What benefit do they get from making people like them?   Anyways, I digress. The good news for the family is the young boy has an ally in the form of the ghost of his deceased grandfather. The old man has the ability to appear to the boy to provide convenient warnings regarding the trolls just because he hates them that much.  One of the strangest scenes in the movie (there are a lot of them) is when the kid receives a vision from grandpa that he must pee on the green icing covered dinner his family is about to eat to keep them from becoming trolls. Luckily he does this right before his sister unknowingly is about to eat some tainted GREEN ICING COVERED CORN ON THE COB. That's not out of the ordinary at all right?   Another wonderfully horrible scene is when two guys venture into the weird troll witch's lair and one of them is turned into a plant, which doesn't really seem to bother him too much.  This movie is so horrible that every adult should be required by law to see it at least once. Newer DVD players are actually being coded to reject this movie upon reading it. Maybe next time a family will move to a town named Llort and the adventures will start all over again. Oh yeah, and maybe next time they'll throw in some gratuitous nudity to transition the scenes. The R rating the nudity would have provided would have actually been a public service because it would have kept impressionable children from watching this mess.\",\n",
       " b'Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it\\'s a success.  Unfortunately, it\\'s still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here, so don\\'t expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it\\'s moment, \"Postal\" wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through.  At its core, Postal is a satire on the United States, as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself, and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.  After the initial surprise wears off, Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.  This probably would have worked as a short movie, but it\\'s just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice tries, but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10',\n",

I was looking forward to seeing it, especially since this is the first time the \"Fab Five\" have been computer animated for a movie. Without giving too many details, the film has all your favorite Disney characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Goofy, and his son Max, Donald and his nephews Huey, Duey, and Louie, and their Uncle Scrooge, and Daisy Duck. There are different stories involving the characters and the true meaning of Christmas. It is a wonderful movie to watch for the holidays, and it has a great story. I highly recommend it, if you are a Disney fan, or like to watch Christmas movies.',\n",

The main character's suspicion, madness, kindness and love, are closely related to what we have inside. Which made me sympathetic and devoted to the character.

'The Eel' is a unique human drama.\",\n",

I even read the 'Doctor' books to see what it was all about, and they left me cold too. Having said that though, it usually gets a look-see whenever it appears on the box (this afternoon for example), just for the quality of the cast and a look at the fifties; and to remind myself of the crush I had on Muriel Pavlow.  It really isn't a relevant film any more, other than as a historical document of Britain as it was and of some of the finest British actors of the period.  It will be on TV again in a few months I suspect, and I also expect that I'll catch a few minutes of it then, if I can. 4/10.\",\n",

It\\'s low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference. Director Brian Yuzna\\'s camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing \"Faust\" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I\\'m of the opinion that people shouldn\\'t even bother adapting comic books to film. \"Faust\" turns into a prime example of why that\\'s true.  4/10',\n",

Knotts and Conway are two investigators called in from Scotland Yard to investigate the death of Lord and Lady Morely, two wealthy British aristocrats. The supporting cast (who one by one mysteriously get knocked off and disappear from the house) which consists of the hired help at the Morely's home are equally hysterical and formidable catalysts to Knotts and Conway's humor. The next time you're at the video store looking for some light, funny fare, check this one out. It's well worth the rental.\",\n",

I must say, I'm not at all a fan of hip drug movies, but the depth of the story and superb acting won me over quickly. This film had an emotional truth to it that makes movies like 'Spun' pale in comparison. It is a gripping tale of redemption, without heavy-handed morality.  Artistically, it is beautiful. The daytime world is black-and-white with selective spots of color, but the film, in a strange and disturbing way, comes to full color and life at night... much like the world of these shady characters.  'Arc' is the ideal of what true independent film should be. Artistic, powerful, and solid, even with limited resources. I'm sure we will be hearing more about it.\",\n",

It is only recently that I\\'ve begun to enjoy musicals. The ones I like are the light ones - not the ones incorporating social issues which I feel musicals are ill-equipped to handle.  But a light musical comedy - with exquisite dancing, charming leads, swank clothes, elegant sets, witty dialogue - WOW! And this is definitely such a musical - absolutely charming.  The four leads are wonderfully cast. Irene Dunne reminds me of Greer Garson in having a certain soulfulness combined with innate gentility and enormous warmth - Dunne also happens to have had a world-class operatic singing voice (that in later movies, as operettas ceased to be appealing, was seldom heard). There is something so very vulnerable about a wounded Irene Dunne character - and she is wonderful in this part.  Randolph Scott has a big, clean, very handsome, American quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part - one in which his character is candid, straightforward, easily swayed by others who are sophisticated -but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken.  Fred Astaire\\'s subordinate comic supporting role is suited well by the enormous difference in size between himself and Scott - and obviously his dancing and his easy way with humorous lines is just wonderful.  The 24 year old Ginger Rogers may be the biggest revelation to me - it\\'s not just that she can dance astonishingly well, that she is wonderful (and wonderfully funny) with accents, that she can sing songs equally comically or romantically (and with great gestures), that she is very VERY funny, whip-smart with dialogue,, but she perfectly suits the job of one hustling for jobs, adapting to all circumstances, rough and ready -- and extremely aware at all times.  I think studio heads really saw Rogers\\' amazing abilities through the end of World War II (after which she was shamefully abandoned) - she seldom played the \"classy woman\" and we instead find her as a shop girl, prisoner on furlough, society wannabe, entertainer. I would like to have seen her play in her career, a part in which she more deliberately seductive (like Barbara Stanwyck or Joan Crawford, Miriam Hopkins or Bette Davis often did) but alas.  You\\'ll like this - just relax and feel yourself enthralled.',\n",

The tragic love story allows us into the garden. Only our own action - or blind ignorance - can allow us out.  Not a lot need be added to the perceptive comments already examining the details of this beautiful and moving film - but Americans, especially those of my fellow Republicans who are able to objectively look at their own country and leaders, should seriously examine the politicians who use fear and nebulous \"enemies\" to gain and hold power in the light of this film. The realization is inescapable that the world of the Finzi-Continis is not that far removed from our own. A question of degree not of kind.  The garden is still seductively attractive, the country around it still relatively free, but will we follow the course the Finzi-Continis took or will we come actively out of our garden while there is time?',\n",

The filmmaker, Jennifer, bares her soul as she uses herself as a tool to address the issues that face women no matter their background or ethnicity. It is a film that all should see, male or female, to better understand the world around us and the strides that still need to be taken to ensure equality and peace. Besides, its political and societal significance, Flying: Confessions of a Free Women, is also a compelling and soap opera like film that, despite its length, flies by in a whirlwind of emotional drama and hilarity.

Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what\\'s on screen instead of enhance it.  Of course, what\\'s on screen is so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look \"hip\" to his Sundance buddies and show how \"edgy\" a filmmaker he is.

The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on.... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's, poor script writing and filming.   The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film, could have easily been made by middle school children. I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated. My advice-Don't Watch It!!!\",\n",
       " b'Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, this could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at his best, and for fans of Maggie, it is great to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way for with and timing. For Englishmen in their fifties (and I am in that bracket), it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the Swinging Sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has plenty of Sixties nostalgia, including red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious shot up the micro-skirt of a waitress, the like of which England has never seen since in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know that the computer hacking tricks are laughable, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.',\n",
       " b'A incredibly innovative film tackling those issues that the major studios are afraid to discuss. An amazingly low budget film, the fact that the guy from hellboy was in it was the only thing that kept me from reaching the remote. A poor decision.  This film is as painfully predictable as it is financially restricted, with the director apparently unsure as to whether to plunge all of his cash into buying quality monkey suits for his actors/stuntmen or hiring real monkeys from the zoo. There is literally no good dialogue whatsoever. Written, shot and edited like a bad episode of \"goosebumps\" this is a film whose studpidity is only equalled by the ineptiude of all those unfortunate/ignorant people involved in the production of this turgid piece of action/adventure fun.   So, to summarise:   Rookie Explorer: \"How many (killer baboons) do you think are in there?\"   Grizzled, been there- killed it- got the tshirt Veteran: \"1 or 2 less than a million\" (referring to a cave which looks to be big enough to hold maybe 10 crazed apes at the most)   Cut To Next Scene; the cave has somehow morphed into a sandy bunker populated by a strange mix of confused looking baboons and desperate for work actors. They are all then killed having failed to realise that attacking one at a time isn\\'t a great long term strategy. etc....  This film is what \"Lost\" will hopefully turn into.',\n",
       " b\"I think that 'Dumplings' takes it all. Well cut from the full length version so that audiences still get the main point. By far, my favorite of the three. Interesting, delightfully sickening, and great performances from all the actors.   'Cut' was a disappointment. Sure, it was gruesome, made one twitch here and there, however, it was pretty much a let down. Attempting to mix comedy and this type of drama was a disaster.   'Box'was very intriguing...until the end is reached. The audience is left thinking, 'All that for THIS?!' But all in all, the good outweighs the bad, and 8 very enthusiastic thumbs up.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie is like the material S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and, had Trueblood actually been a product of either, the results might've been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.  Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I suppose is the accurate description. This was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music. Nonetheless, Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when, on the run from the cops, he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before Ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother, Donny.  For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this has to do with far too much overacting, although not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he befriends. The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as New York street toughs. Although, the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989.\",\n",
       " b'From the Salkinds brothers, the same producers of \"Superman\" saga, comes the first and, for the moment, last adventure of the new heroine coming from DC comics: was Supergirl: the Superman\\'s cousin. The movie is one of the worst superhero\\'s pictures never made; director Jeannot Szwarc give very bad work, as on the hand we would expect from a subscriber to the flop like he. The screenplay by David Odell is really silly and campy; the history is absurd and full of holes. The plot: Kara(Helen Slater)is a blond young girl from Argo city. Argo is a fragment of the planet Krypton in \"innerspace\"; the survivor Community is powered by the Omega Hedron, a spherical powerful object invented by city\\'s founder Zaltar(Peter O\\'Toole). Superman\\'s cousin Kara is shown by Zaltar how to use Omegahedron to help inspire her art. But an insect she animates causes chaos and accidentally sucks the Omegahedron down a warp vortex. The magical sphere end up on Earth and falls into the clutches of a evil witch Faye Dunaway....sorry Selena(played by Faye Dunaway). Selena is a second-rate sorceress that lives in a converted amusement park with her sidekick Bianca(Brenda Vaccaro); the witch is studying black magic with the aid of her old boyfriend Nigel(Peter Cook); Nigel is a local math teacher and warlock. The eccentric Selena really is little more than a clumsy charlatan but she is really crazy and megalomaniac; her dream is nothing less than world domination! While Selena plans to use the sphere\\'s powers to rule the world; Kara steals an experimental spaceship and on Earth, becoming Supergirl: the girl of steal; now the long-blond-tressed Kara enrolls in a girl-school as a brunette using the name Linda Lee, while searching for the Omegahedron in her spare time wearing the familiar costume of her cousin Superman. Selena is at that age where she\\'s not the spring chicken; she develops lust for the handsome school gardener Ethan and spikes his beer with a potion that will make him fall for the first woman he sees and of course this women is Supergirl; she and Selena come into conflict. In the final crash the witch invoking the Burundi wand, she screams \"Power of Shadow... Appear!\" and she summons a huge demon. \"Power of Shadow... Destroy her!\" Flying up to confront the demon, Supergirl is captured in its grasp and it starts crushing her. Using her amazing strength, Supergirl frees herself from the demon and using her super-speed, Supergirl circles Selena and the wind she creates lifts Selena before the demon; Supergirl summons her inner strength to turn the tables and make the demon eat witch. Magically, the demon with her bore food and Bianca all fade away through the mirror to the Phantom Zone. Of course good triumphs over evil and Kara returns to Argo City with the Omegahedron. The movie\\'s special effects aren\\'t bad and the Jerry Goldsmith\\'s score is wonderful. The majors guilty of this box office flop are Szwarc and Odell but the acting is another problem for this movie although the all-star cast. Nineteen year-old Helen Slater in her first film appearance is a perfect choice as Supergirl; she looked like she had jumped right out of the pages of the comic books for Supergirl, she\\'s charming rather than sexy, graceful and convincing in the flying scenes with her little costume and her nice blonde hair. Supporting cast members include the completely wasted Peter Cook, the annoying Brenda Vacarro, a embarrassed Mia Farrow, as Kara\\'s mother, the very attractive Hart Bochner that was quite good under trying circumstances and Peter O\\'Toole, who\\'s always fun to watch when he overacts. All obviously were phoning it in for the paycheck. Faye Dunaway\\'s acting is the worst in the movie. She is mostly dreadful as the wicked would-be witch Selena, it certainly wasn\\'t all Faye Dunaway\\'s fault, since she just got stuck with a terribly written character, but she was over-the-top hamming and overplays outrageously. Her character is idiot, boring and silly and Dunaway chews her ridiculous lines with unjustified gusto because her Selena remains the lamest and worst of all the villains from the Superman-related movies. Selena was the baddest evil witch of all time, with scenery-chewing of unimaginable proportions notwithstanding this Dunaway vamps like a enormous peacock but one thing is sure that she is not a charming and imperious witch like the glamorous Anjelica Huston in movie The Witches. Dunaway is really ungraceful and unattractive as a grotesquely middle-aged women that know some magic, gesture wildly, utter some made-up \\'abracadabra\\' bullshit. She looks awful like a true classic witch from tales; with horrid red curly wig and a make-up that make her features coarse and more vulgar she seems a man in drag . But really Dunaway is the only reason for watch this movie because her camping is so over-the-top and her appearance is so bad than she becomes fascinating to watch in its terribleness. She likes herself in a way very narcissistic; I kept waiting for her performance to finally says -I ready for my close-up Mr. Demille-. But truly even cheeky Brenda Vaccaro as her accomplice Bianca reacts with comically exaggerated expressions over Faye\\'s plans for world domination and her defines a horrid human being. There are few moments where Dunaway is really really ridiculous: when she was trying painfully to seduce the muscle-man Etahn; when she was prepare a love-potion with a spider and a hazel\\'s shell but especially in the final when she rolls one\\'s eyes and make terrible smirks and laughs. After her tour-de-force of overacting, her irritating wry faces and ways affected poor Dunaway end up really badly: a horrid monster bites evil Faye\\'s head off. It\\'s a just punishment for Dunaway\\'s crimes against humanity, acting and fashion and it\\'s a great relief for the audience.',\n",
       " b\"A bad one.  Oh, my...this is one of the movies, which doesn't have even one positive effect. Just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky. I just wonder how low I.Q. you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.   Is there something than this is worth watching for? Well, there is a lot of nudity involved, but it's nothing particular. And when you just think that it couldn't get worse, your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old. C'mon guys, where did you search for these actresses. In elderly home, perhaps.   Anyway, the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it. Again, too bad, that she is too skinny & old. All in all, skip these one.  2 out of 10\",\n",
       " b'This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn\\'t show Daltry\\'s screams after the line \"Tommy doesn\\'t know what day it is...\", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We\\'re Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete\\'s blazing guitar chords. Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band. It\\'s a very frustrating film to watch, and doesn\\'t deliver the goods. I don\\'t know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him. To its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. This might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you\\'re not anticipating Tommy. The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD.',\n",
       " b'Watching this Movie? l thought to myself, what a lot of garbage. These girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it. Waste of time watching it, faint heavens l only hired it. The acting was below standard and story was unbearable. Anyone contemplating watching this film, please save your money. The film has no credit at all. l am a real film buff and this is worse than \"Attack of the Green Tomatoes\".  l only hope that this piece of trash didn\\'t cost too much to make. Money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world. l only hope there isn\\'t a sequel in the pipeline.',\n",
       " b'Typical formula action film: a good cop gets entangled in a mess of crooked cops and Japanese gangsters.  The okay result has decent performances, a few fleeting snicker-inducing moments, and some fair action sequences--plus a chance to check out the gorgeous Danielle Harris--who makes the most of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teen daughter.  ** out of ****.',\n",
       " b\"Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.\",\n",
       " b\"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.\",\n",
       " b'Along with \"Brothers & Sisters\", \"Six Degrees\" was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006.   Great cast all around, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the come-back photog) and Hope Davis (recent widow of journalist killed in Iraq).  Aside from the acting, the writing was fresh and the acting superb. The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not the Warner Bros. or some other studio\\'s backlot, adding a secondary layer or realism.   I guess people are more interested in the latest \"Survivor\" and other reality garbage. Too bad it didn\\'t last.',\n",
       " b'At face value LA MOUSTACHE appears to be an exercise in far-fetched, existential conceit. The trailer certainly doesn\\'t allow a prospective viewer any more information than its premise: a man shaves off his moustache in an effort to change his image. His girlfriend doesn\\'t notice. As a matter of fact... no one does. He begins to get increasingly disturbed that no one would notice something as elemental as facial hair... and then things suddenly spiral out of control.  Certainly it would make anyone think: \"Come on, now. A thriller about a man losing his mind because no one has noticed he shaved his moustache off? Isn\\'t this taking it a little too far?\" The truth of the matter is, it\\'s not -- LA MOUSTACHE is merely a set-up in the most elusive of ways, creeping up on the viewer like the best of the Polanski apartment thrillers (where nothing is as it seems) -- and it sends the hapless Marc (Vincent Lindon) into a world that doubles in on itself one-fold, two-fold, while seeming chillingly normal.  Maybe it\\'s a commentary on the dangers of being too wealthy (because had we had a struggling couple, something as banal as a moustache wouldn\\'t even enter the picture). Marc and Agnes (Emmanuelle Devos) live what can be called a life in the lap of luxury in a sleek loft apartment. They seem to be elementally happy, until one minor, laughably trivial incident throws them into an increasingly jarring descent into marital alienation of the likes of the unhappy couple in George Cukor\\'s GASLIGHT with the genders switched, which grows creepier as Marc suddenly becomes suspicious of everything around him and wonders if events in his life have even occurred. Because as simple as that, from the denial of a moustache\\'s existence, now his own is in peril.  And from here on, the story manages to go into uncharted territory, and giving more details about it would be essentially spoiling the fun that this very suppressed, very elegant thriller is. LA MOUSTACHE is an intriguing puzzle in some ways akin to the puzzle of CACHE, where another couple\\'s happiness becomes ensnared in an intrigue that may or may not be happening. Sparse, deliberate while not being too slow (yet not revealing too much too soon), this is a high-concept thriller that should be seen.',\n",
       " b\"The film adopted a minimalistic approach, which means there are very little conversation, no grand stage-setup, and unfortunately, no story. Honestly speaking, I did not understand the film. The story itself is not plausible. It says that a watch seller sold a watch to a woman who would go to Paris. After that, the watch seller would adjust all the clocks he sees to the Paris time. The watch seller's mother went crazy because her husband died. The woman who went to Paris felt lonely and slept with another woman. That's absolutely all I could get from story, if there were any story at all. The three subplots did not link with each other, they were so scattered and they did not make any sense, either individually or collectively.  There were occasionally one or two funny scenes, where all the viewers bursted out laughing. Still, this does not make a boring film good. This film cold be compressed into half an hour, if the shots were not so long.  For the two hours that I watched the film, I felt extremely bored. I can't wait for the film to finish! I must say I do not know what is so artistic about this film. Maybe I don't know how to appreciate this kind of approach of making a film.\",\n",
       " b\"This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one. This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film. At first, the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves, even if grudgingly, through each other. Rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread. Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt.\",\n",
       " b'This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.  The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.  The dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is \"love\" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.  This is simply a gem of a movie that you can\\'t miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!',\n",
       " b'This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it\\'s not about dieting, it\\'s about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this. Beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yells the words, \"It\\'s not about you.\" to her mother. Those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie. I think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.',\n",

       " b'A terrible waste of celluloid, Ruzowitzky\\'s \"All the Queens men\" is even worse than one might expect. The screenplay is unimaginably stupid, with scenes that don\\'t connect at all to each other. The acting is really bad, and that\\'s no surprise, because there is not even one decent character in the script. How could anyone ever have thought that it was a good idea to spend money on this film? It also seems like Ruzowitzky had no idea at all what he was doing, because the film changes from a pseudo realistic \"bad times in world war II\" drama to a silly, unintelligent, extremely stupid pseudo \"comedy\" all the time. The film looks ugly and cheap (the vfx have to be a joke) and is just a waste of time. DON\\'T WATCH THIS FILM!  It\\'s not funny, it\\'s not suspenseful, it\\'s a piece of crap.

       " b\"One has to remember, that with the introduction of Shaft and Superfly, Hollywood churned out one blaxploitation film after the other, whether the script and acting succeeded or not. During the 70's, at the height of the blaxploitation film era, the genre was completely plot-driven rather than character-driven. Ask yourself how many times a neighborhood could be saved from some type of demolition? How many times could someone come up with just the right lottery numbers? Take this film for what it is, something lighthearted that introduced actor/director Thomas Carter, II, Debbi Morgan of All My Children, Charmed, The Hurricane, Rosalind Cash of The Omega Man, General Hospital, and Tales from the Hood, Randy Brooks of Another World and Generations. And, of course, Rudy Ray Moore. These actors had to eat, support families, and it was training ground for some later great work.\",\n",
       " b'This is one shoddy piece of work. Not hateful, because it doesn\\'t actively promote antisocial behavior, and not bad enough to be unintentionally amusing either. It\\'s a straightforward attempt to cobble together a cheap movie, while putting no time or effort into it, and drawing in enough patrons to make a profit.  A handful of archaeologists, led by John Agar, are digging up and decoding plaques with \"cuneiform\" writing on them, though what we see bears no resemblance to any cuneiform that a Sumerian might have seen. The other scientists look over John Agar\\'s shoulder while he reads a particularly puzzling plaque and rattles off allusions to The Gilgamesh Epic. This prompts them to climb a mountain that looks like K-2 in order to search for more clues. Near the peak, an avalanche almost buries them, but it also exposes a ruined Sumerian city.  So far, so typical of Warner Brothers\\' 1950s SF/fantasy flicks, and not without interest. But then the ice breaks under the feet of one of the scientists and he plunges into a hole so deep that Agar, peering in behind his flashlight, can\\'t see the bottom.  I ask you -- the experienced mountain climber -- what would you do under these circumstances? A member of your team has fallen into what appears to be a bottomless pit. Here\\'s what THEY do. With no more than a flashlight and a bit of climbing equipment, one by one, they lower themselves \"hundreds of feet\" into the black pit with no way of getting back up except by hoisting themselves hand over hand. How John Agar expects to do that is left unexplained -- never mind chunky Nestor Paiva.  The handful of middle-aged men find their colleague\\'s dead body. Nobody bothers to mourn or comment on the loss. They don\\'t have much time anyway because, before you know it, they discover a lost civilization of pale Sumerians who live on mushrooms, except for one beautiful babe (Cynthia Patrick, the best actor in the bunch) who looks reasonably human and has something resembling a tan. The Sumerian king assigns her to be Agar\\'s consort. When Agar retires, she goes with him and he must gently fend her off because, after all, he\\'s a man of principle. It turns out that the Sumerians decide all their visitors must die -- BUT -- they are afraid of \"the fire of Ishtar,\" meaning the flashlight.  But why go on? It deteriorates into one of Edgar Rice Burroughs\\' half-schizophrenic novels. \"Tarzan Goes to Mars,\" or something. Lots of scenes of beastly half-hominids laboring among the lava pits and being whipped by their Sumerian masters. Sumerian soldiers chasing the archaeologists waving swords but being held back by the fire of Ishtar.  I don\\'t know how it ends. I own the DVD and I can\\'t bring myself to finish watching it. I really tried to find it ridiculous enough to raise a smile but I couldn\\'t generate any feeling except a fierce boredom.  It\\'s hard to imagine that this was intended to be seen by anyone over the age of nine or ten.',\n",
       " b\"I can watch this film just for the flying.  I'd love to get my hands on all of the footage and remake it with a descent plot.  Although intended to showcase American airpower in the 50's, it could be redone as cold war retro flick because the footage is still cool and beautiful. This the only place you will likely ever see some off that magnificent old hardware in use.  We know the Duke was a hardcore anti-communist as was Howard Hughes. The two no doubt saw eye-to-eye on politics, ergo it is no surprise that they would both be involved in this movie, yet it was probably a bad idea for the Duke. Some people consider it his worst movie (through no fault of his own, the script is ludicrous). I doubt even the red hunting members of the House Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC) could take it seriously.  Still, it has a really cool theater poster. It's a painting of the Duke in an old P-2 flight helmet with the late/post WW2 style flying goggles (althought I believe they use the P-4 helmet in the movie. The P-4 is just a P-2 with a big retractable visor screwed on. The visor replaced the old style goggles).   Again, it also has some great aerial footage, which is what you would expect from Hughes.\",\n",

       " b\"Slaughter Studios starts as an actor named Justin is shot & killed on the set of his latest film, was it an accident or something more sinister? Either way Slaughter Studios has remained unused & empty ever since... Jump forward 20 years & aspiring low budget horror filmmaker Steve (Peter Stanovich) is going to break into Slaughter Studios & use the unused but still intact stages for his latest project. To help him he has assembled a crew of friends, production assistant Madigan (Amy Shelton-White), Gary (Matthew J.Roseman) the cameraman, Ollie (Anand Chulani) the sound-man, & his cast of actors, Kevin (Nicolas Reed), Chad (Darren Reiher), goth babe Trisha (Eva Frajko), Rebecca (Laura Oatis), Darlene (Serra Ellison), Candace (Lorissa McComas) & Portia (Tara Killian). Together they break into the abandoned Slaugher Studios & get to work, however it appears that they are not alone as a killer stalks the corridors of the once busy studio...  Edited & directed by Brian Katkin I really liked Slaughter Studios. On paper the script by Dan Acre & John Huckert looks pretty lousy, a horror comedy about a bunch of annoying teenagers being killed by a mysterious killer but in fact Slaughter Studios turned out to be a really likable & decent film. I hated Ollie but I found the rest of the character's very likable & were quite funny with some nice witty dialogue. The whole film-within-a-film, Blair Witch Project (1999) anyone?, has been done before but Slaughter Studios incorporates it really well & the whole self referential jokes & mickey taking is done with a certain affection for the genre. There are a few good laughs here including a pretty funny farting in a tent gag! I really liked the ending as well, I definitely wasn't expecting it & was both a clever & satisfying way to round the film off. Slaughter Studios never takes itself seriously, it moves along at a fair pace & is never boring or dull & makes for good entertainment. Don't get me wrong as it's far from a masterpiece but believe me you could do a hell of a lot worse than Slaughter Studios when you compare it to the straight-to-video crap that litter video shop shelves these days.  Director Katkin does an impressive job, the lighting is excellent with bright neon greens, blues & reds along side the dark shadowy corners. The film looks great throughout & only the cheap looking digital video used to shoot it on gives it's low budget away. There is plenty of nudity, some lesbianism including a funny exchange of dialogue with the director convincing Portia that going nude & participating in acts if lesbianism would make her a better actress! The gore isn't so plentiful, a pick-axe in someones stomach, someones throat is cut with some film & someone has a pitchfork stuck through them & there's a decapitated head.  With a supposed budget of about $50,000 the filmmakers have worked absolute miracles. Slaughter Studios went straight-to-video but looks really good from start to finish & they obviously made that $50,000 go a long way. The acting varies, Chulani is absolutely awful. Frajko as the goth bird Trisha is a bit of a babe & really easy on the eyes.  Slaughter Studios surprised me, a lot. I thought it was a highly entertaining & funny spoof comedy horror slasher. As a horror film fan you have to be able to take a chance on a film you've never heard of that will in all likelihood turn out to be complete & utter crap, most low budget straight-to-video horror films fall into this category. But once in a while you are rewarded with a bit of an unexpected gem & Slaughter Studios was just such an occasion for me, definitely worth a watch.\",\n",

       " b\"Like many of you I am a great fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us longing for the past. The term 'neo-noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact. John Dahl's film on the other hand, truly deserved to be described as such. The casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated it. Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to, and I'm not even that old. Movies such as Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.\",\n",

My inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime.  The film\\'s production values were very good. The acting isn\\'t bad (apart from the Shatnerism of the actor who played governor\\'s aide that someone else here mentioned).

       " b'Although there are a lot of familiar \"television\" names associated with \"A Man Called Sledge\", there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960\\'s-70\\'s television series like \"The Rat Patrol\" is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.   James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (\"Maverick\", \"Support Your Local Sheriff\"-\"Gunfighter\" etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood\\'s spaghetti western character. But Eastwood\\'s stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.  I suppose that \"A Man Called Sledge\" could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced \"Combat\" television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose.   The plot is the standard \"big heist\" thing (insert \"The War Wagon\" here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of \"Alias Smith and Jones\" with the same plot.  The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer\\'s interest.  The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.   Then again, what do I know? I\\'m only a child.',\n",

       " b\"MASK is the 1985 comedy-drama based on the true story of Rocky Dennis, a sensitive and highly intelligent teenager who, because of a debilitating disease, has a severely disfigured face that has made him an outcast outside of his family and the social circle surrounding them (basically a biker gang, who are savagely protective of Rocky). The film focuses primarily on Rocky's relationship with his mother Rusty (Cher), a free-spirited independent woman whose history of drug and alcohol abuse and sexual promiscuity has been such a concern to Rocky that it's sometimes hard to tell who's raising who in the Dennis household. The film is basically unfolds as a series of vignettes, highlighting the ups and downs of Rocky and Rusty's relationship, which seems to rise above everything else that happens in their lives. No matter what Rocky and Rusty go through, their love for each other rises above everything and makes all their fallacies fade to the background. Peter Bogdonovich's evocative direction is a big plus here, knowing where to mine the laughs and the tears and the film contains plenty of both. Cher gives the performance of her career as Rusty Dennis (even better than her Oscar winning turn in MOONSTRUCK) and an unrecognizable Eric Stoltz hits all the right notes as the soulful and intelligent Rocky. Sam Elliott is solid as Rusty's on-again, off-again boyfriend Gar and Laura Dern shines as a blind girl who Rocky falls for. Mention should also be made of Dennis Burkley as a slow-witted family friend and of Richard Dysart and the late Estelle Getty who register in one scene as Rusty's parents. Don't miss this lovely emotional drama that perfectly blends laughter and tears to maximum effect.\",\n",

They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography.

       " b'I love the idea of a talent show that focuses on more than just singing, especially the same old adult contemporary music that we hear over and over and over again on the likes of American Idol, Star Search, or any other popular talent competition. The problem is that when it comes down to it it ends up being nothing more than a singing competition with some other performers thrown in for good measure, but without a shot at winning.  The \"judges\" constantly berate people for not being diverse or \"mixing it up\" enough, which flies in the face of what the show is supposed to be about. Take, for instance, the martial arts exhibition group Sideswipe. They were told by all of the judges that they wanted to see more than just punching and kicking, and that they had to do more dancing and add more production to their numbers if they were going to have a shot at winning. WHAT!?!?!? They are a martial arts group. . . . . PUNCHING AND KICKING IS WHAT THEY DO!!! Why not tell the singers that they need to add more flips and jumps and tumbling to their acts? When it comes down to it the judges, and America, do not consider anything other than singing to be real talent, and that is a shame, because the variety is what could be the shows strongest feature.  In defense of the show, there is much more variety than you will see on American Idol. At the end of the second season there is a blues/reggae singer, a young American Idolish singer (though not of the same caliber), a ventriloquist/impressionist whose act is 99% singing, and a beat boxing singer. There is more variety than many other talent competitions, but it would be really nice to see more of the true variety acts and far fewer singing acts.  Another negative is that the show would be totally unwatchable without TIVO. Less than half of every show actually involves performing, and they spend way too much time on background info and letting you know what is coming up \"after the break.\"',\n",
       " b\"Dour, moody, petulant, very masculine and unsociable loner abattoir worker Marcos (a fine, low-key, creepily nonchalant performance by Vincente Parra) and his peevish, unhappy girlfriend (the lovely Emma Cohen) take a ride in a taxi one fateful night. The irritable cab driver tosses them out when they start making out in the back of his taxi. Marcos and the cabbie have an altercation which results in the cabbie being killed. Marcos' girlfriend wants to tell the cops. Marcos, who's distrustful of authority due to his lowly working class social status, throttles his girlfriend in a fit of pique. Pretty soon Marcos becomes extremely paranoid and begins to kill every last person who suspects him of being a homicidal maniac (Marcos even whacks his own brother with a wrench). Marcos strikes up an uneasy friendship with an earnest, but suspicious gay neighbor. Things get even more tense. Meanwhile, Marcos chops up the corpses residing in his spartan, squalid rathole abode and disposes of the body parts by incinerating them in the slaughterhouse furnace.  A grave, gruesome, exceedingly unnerving and disconcerting depiction of how severe self-loathing and one's miserably meager station in life can feasibly drive you murderously around the bend (Marcos registers strongly as a hauntingly sullen and scarily twisted proletarian anti-hero), this dark, stark, deeply disturbing and harrowingly plausible psychological horror portrait of everyday gratuitous violence, repressed sexuality (there's an edgy air of homo-eroticism apparent in the relationship between Marcos and his meddlesome neighbor), and seething, volatile little guy angst makes for a very queasy and unsettling viewing experience. The late, great Eloy de la Iglesia's taut, austere, fiercely humorless and deliberate direction, ably assisted by Raul Artigot's grainy, gloriously unadorned no-frills cinematography, Fernando G. Morcillo's spare, spooky, nerve-jangling score, occasional outbursts of hideously graphic and genuinely shocking violence, gradual pacing, an unsparingly solemn tone, and properly subdued naturalistic acting from the uniformly solid cast, creates a frightfully squirmy and sweaty suffocating gloom-doom atmosphere which ultimately delivers one hell of a potent and lingering kick-you-in-the-gut wallop. Anchor Bay's typically up-to-par DVD offers a nice widescreen presentation with the trailer as the sole extra.\",\n",

She is also a former Miss Colorado. Her acting isn't bad either in this movie and she is the main character.

       " b'Modern Chinese History forms the backdrop for this sweeping portrait of the Soong Sisters, three siblings who married powerful men and used their positions to influence the politics of early 20th Century China. The film spans the period from the formation of the Chinese Republic in 1911 to the take-over by the Communists in 1949. The details of history take a back seat to the real focus of this movie, however, which delves into the intricate and intimate relationships these women have with their husbands, their parents, and each other.  Lushly photographed and superbly acted, the movie showcases the talents of three veteran actors of Asian Cinema. Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung and Vivian Wu play sisters Ai-ling, Ching-ling, and May-ling Soong. All three seem well-cast and bring the full weight of their skill and experience to their roles. The move sizzles with electricity when these three beauties appear on screen together, as they do in several scenes. This is definitely a case where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Wen Jian gives an outstanding performance as father Charlie Soong, despite dying off half-way through the story. The death-bed scene, where he passes away in the presence of his wife and three daughters, is especially moving. Winston Chao and Hsing-Kuo Wu take sold turns as Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek.  The story explores a number of themes in both a personal and social/historical context. Conflicts between father/daughter, old values/new values, old China/new China, and East/West all figure prominently in the plot. A shoe metaphor runs through-out the film, depicting the step-by-step movement of Chinese history, bringing to mind the old Chinese proverb, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\" This motif also reflects the increased role of women in Chinese social and political life, as they are liberated from the foot-binding that hobbled previous generations.  The movie is slow-moving at times, with some abrupt plot transitions. Director Mabel Cheung occasionally hits us over the head with that shoe to get her point across, and the script seems to contain some hints of political propaganda. Nevertheless, I found this to be a well-made and highly entertaining piece of Asian Cinema. Sadly, this movie is not likely to reach a wide North American audience because it\\'s in Mandarin with English sub-titles. That\\'s too bad, because it is just as accomplished as anything coming out of Hollywood these days, and well worth seeing.  ****/5 stars.',\n",
       " b\"Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick (Tim Young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. The poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers. Unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after Lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. However something magical happens (no, the film doesn't suddenly become good), Lester's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell...  Co-written, co-produced & directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. Duforq although I don't remember any character of this name, I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. The script by Itier, Bill Cunningham & Jason White uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. We've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town Sheriff's make matters even worse before. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest. The film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting & the kills are forgettable. You know I'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn...  Director Itier doesn't do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix (1999) or some Japanese kung-fu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. Don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know he's a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! There's no nudity & the gore isn't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.  With a supposed budget of about $250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they didn't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... The acting sucks, the guy who played Lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on his accent...  Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows (1988). Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman & Al Pacino film Scarecrow (1973) or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow (2008) which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer (2003) & Scarecrow Gone Wild (2004).\",\n",

Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn\\'t much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie\\'s face at the ending speaks volumes.

       " b'Without a doubt, Bava left his mark on popular cinema with \"Twitch of the Death Nerve.\" It is one of the earliest \\'slashers\\' I\\'ve ever seen. The best thing about Bava\\'s classic is that it starts out in traditional Bava fashion as a sort of Gothic piece and then it generates into a much more modern-feeling horror film with kids at a lake being hunted by a psychopath.  The blood flows in this one, probably Bava\\'s most gory. It\\'s ashame that he didn\\'t make more like this, but I think his talent was actually the old school horror pieces like \"Blood and Black Lace,\" which was actually an even earlier slasher from Bava. The difference is that \"Blood and Black Lace\" lacks the theme that is now so popular, with kids being stalked and hunted. That is where \"Twitch\" wins the crown.  With all there is to love about this awesome flick, I still have to gripe a bit. The ending is a little vague. I am still not too sure what happened, but the twist only halfway works.

This film 'borrows' style and script elements from Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Don't Look Now, It's Alive and even tiny details from Hammer and Amicus successes. The screenplay is extremely poorly written and Peter Sasdy's directing is the worst of all disasters. What happened to this guy? He was responsible for an endless amount of great TV-movies and a few downright classic Hammer titles (like 'Countess Dracula' and 'Hands of the Ripper') but, ever since Doomwatch, he just seems to make crap. This production is very banal, not the least bit scary or atmospheric and the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. It looks like this film is blessed with a terrific all-star cast, but everybody is performing far below their normal acting skills. Donald Pleasance looks dead long before his character is actually slaughtered and Ralph Bates' character is far too fake. Eileen Atkins triumphs as the worst cast-member though. She stars as an Italian nun (?) and speaks with the most atrocious accent I ever heard. The only one that gets a little sympathy is the beautiful Caroline Munro as the sexy cabaret dancer.

       " b'Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception.   Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a \"60 Minutes\" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer \"Lowell Bergman,\" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist \"Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,\" and Christopher Plummer as \"Mike Wallace\" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.  There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It\\'s simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann\\'s \"Heat,\" except without the violence.  The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that\\'s not surprising being it\\'s about \"60 Minutes.\" I wasn\\'t surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I\\'m not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn\\'t shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.  Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making. What else can you say?',\n",
       " b'Robert Goddard is a fantastic author, specialising in twisty and turny British historical thrillers. I was psyched when I saw that \"Into the Blue\\' had been adapted for the small screen, being one of the finest book in a \\'trilogy\\' of sorts. Harry Barnett is highly engaging character, and John Thaw portrays him well, warts and all. The only deterrent to the TV version is that it\\'s far too short. It would have, in this writers opinion, worked better as a mini-series, as the movie leaves out whole scenes from the book and loses the feeling of helplessness that Harry Barnett feels to his plight. On the whole, \"Into the Blue\" is disappointing, not living up to a really good book. Check out the follow-ups, \"Into the Sun\" and \"Never go Back\".',\n",
       " b\"The first time I saw this film, I loved it. It was different.  I am a Christian (Bible believing). I don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers. I dropped out of that atmosphere.  To me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it the Judas Syndrome.  Judas didn't get it, even though Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world.  This film certainly showed some of that.  I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples.  Also he was a very gorgeous Jesus.  It's a watch-over and over movie.  Very satisfying.\",\n",
       " b'Noll\\'s comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments, often with expletives, to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues, using more language than necessary. This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you\\'re in for a treat!  The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a \"lost era\". Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care. The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done.',\n",
       " b'I rented this film because of Angus MacFadyen, who did such a great job in \"Cradle Will Rock.\" I am also very impressed with his work here. \"Cranes\" is a story about the many complicated facets of coming out, keeping secrets, sharing life with others, and being true to yourself. It has a richly thoughtful plot, and some of the sweetest love scenes I\\'ve seen. It\\'s definitely a must see for gay/queer/rainbow folk, and those who want to understand a little more about coming out.',\n",
       " b\"Happened upon a copy of this. Not mine and if I had spent my own money on this I'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back! All I can say is this would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the medium of film is absent. Acting is god awful, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable.  I can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad.  Amateur in the extreme!   Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!\",\n",
       " b'So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I\\'d pass a half hour watching \"Girlfight\" while waiting for \"Hart\\'s War\" to start. With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation \\'B\\' flic about inner city girl gangs.  Much to my surprise it wasn\\'t about that at all. Instead it is a well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn\\'t really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father\\'s wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead.   The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. For starters, her brother\\'s coach doesn\\'t want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.  All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed \"Million Dollar Baby\" I thought \"wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar\". Needless to say, I didn\\'t watch \"Hart\\'s War\" that night.',\n",
       " b'Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there. All the things director Michael Lindsay-Hogg filmed were fascinating to me especially when Ringo played some piano with Paul or when John and Yoko danced or when Heather-a young pre-teen who\\'s Paul\\'s future wife Linda\\'s daughter from a previous marriage-hung around the Apple Studios. (Oh, and while I did know of George\\'s argument with Paul over George\\'s guitar playing from an outtake that was used in \"The Beatles\\' Anthology\", only Paul\\'s explanation to him about that is in here.) Then there\\'s organ pianist Billy Preston who might have officially become the fifth Beatle had the group not split up some time after this film. The real exciting part was the legendary rooftop concert that caused some traffic and had Paul ad libbing some lines about getting arrested at the end of \"Get Back\"! What a way to end the film and loved hearing mostly positive comments from the crowd below. So on that note, Let It Be is very essential viewing for all Beatles fans or just any that loves good music performed live on film.',\n",
       " b\"Cary Grant's got a real problem on his hands. He thinks his wife was killed in a plane crash seven years ago. So he goes to court with Gail Patrick who he now intends to marry after getting the judge to declare Irene Dunne legally dead.  Wouldn't you know it, Dunne turns up the day of the honeymoon and puts Cary in an awful pickle. He's a lawyer and he's busy trying to work out all the ramifications of what's happened.   I've thought about it for a while and I came to the conclusion that it's Grant's professional training that prevents him from just confessing to one and all what's happened. Where a lot of the laughs come in is Grant trying to avoid marital consummation with Patrick until he can work it out.  Another factor comes into play when Grant learns that Dunne spent several years on the desert island with hunky Randolph Scott. Grant starts to feel a little less guilty then.  The whole mess is dumped on the judge who originally declared Dunne legally dead, Granville Bates. His role as the judge gives him some of the best lines in My Favorite Wife.  I do feel sorry for Gail Patrick though. Usually she plays a lot of bad girls and other women in movies. But she really is the wronged party here.  Dunne and Grant worked well together in another marital comedy, The Awful Truth and they were just as bright in My Favorite Wife as they were in the first film.  One interesting footnote it was a remake of this film Something's Gotta Give that Marilyn Monroe did not complete. Eventually it was made over with Doris Day and James Garner.  That one was good, but this one is great.\",\n",
       " b'You get a gift. It is exquisitely wrapped. The box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. That is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. It is a sight to behold.  Then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. That\\'s TOYS. You either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.  The film isn\\'t without its point and purpose: War is a not a good thing. Well, isn\\'t that original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. And even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It\\'s like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying \"Just kidding.\"  But even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. Yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. Indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. For this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an Oz far removed from Kansas. Every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.  It is said that this was director Barry Levinson\\'s pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. It is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. Like most pet projects that finally get made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker\\'s field of vision. Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. He had already perfected it to death.  Many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. So is the film itself.',\n",

       " b'it brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends 20 years up the line - remember or seem to suffer from. Up the line all is described as friendly jostling, maybe periodically described as \"picking on\" one or more of them, but all is forgiven. There is no *angst* embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structures.  Totally amazing! Not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last. In this respect this movie is a tiny Pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film: A portrait of unforced emotions binding people together. Which, when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily springs to mind, but since mid 80\\'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood (accompanied by 1000s of commercials, animations and series directed straight at children) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse, the loneliness, the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds.  And here comes a film, that says: It IS possible to have a happy childhood, look\\'a\\'here!  Thank you for that. OR the counterweight illusion ...  8/10',\n",

After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. Vivah is so so cheesy that Badjatyas have left Johars and Chopras behind.  There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. Aloknath does clich\\xc3\\xa9 in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.

Oprah cannot resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks. She often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote. Directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest\\'s faces because that\\'s what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says.  Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It\\'s always all about Oprah.  Oprah says - Feel sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my hurt when I\\'m turned away from a fancy store after they\\'ve already closed. Feel good for buying my magazines and books. Feel good for my success. Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good. Feel good for making me rich beyond belief.  My interpretation of her point of view: YOU VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life though I have nothing in common with you plebes. I have never been married nor do I want to be. I have never had to raise a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness \"Legends Ball 2006\". Gayle is my best friend but we are not gay.  As of 7/31/2006, the heading on her website actually reads : \"Oprah.com is your leading source for information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health.\" How presumptive and obnoxious is that ?   In June 2006, she crashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather footage for her September 2006 shows. She keeps promising to quit TV but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight.  Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from God. She\\'s just one very lucky, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue\\'s style and called it her own. She happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic.   Oprah is the P.T.

       " b'This film has a sort of disclaimer at the beginning that says something along the lines of \"some may find this offensive\". And sure, this is in bad taste, it\\'s sort of a comedy/parody of a Columbine-type incident. Probably what\\'s the most offensive though is the poor production values and the possibly even poorer acting. Of course, the folks that gave us movies like \"Airplane\" would most likely not touch subject matter like THIS with a 50-foot pole, so we\\'re stuck with Smack & Hellfire (the names of the film makers). We have Carbine High School, and all the fine stereotypes that go there; the jocks, the greasers, the religious nuts, the Goths, the whitey-hating Afro-American, and then the two that don\\'t fit in anywhere, the ones in the black trench coats. Of course you know who they are. There are some mildly amusing bits, like these two ordering a nuclear warhead off the internet using one\\'s drunken mom\\'s credit card, and having it arrive in a big box with NO packing material....! Also a scene where the two misfits go to get guns and there\\'s sort of a musical interlude where topless (but masked) models display the wares, but that\\'s about it really, as far as the parts that were genuinely amusing, because the direction of the film is so inept that most other attempts at humor are pretty low grade, juvenile stuff. With a decent budget and some competent film makers, this might have been at least watchable but as it is, it\\'s borderline excruciating. 4 out of 10.',\n",

I mean, I do like \"Under siege\", \"Die hard\" and also some of Jacky Chan\\'s works, but these flicks at least do have descent settings and some funny dialogue.

       " b\"===minor spoilers===   I am, like many others, a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before MI:2, expectations were rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar- Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? A lot.   The script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting. You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa!! you've got comedy? I don't think so. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Think not. Then comes the best bit- the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Are you seeing anybody?' 'What went wrong?' etc.  Then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases. They're disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there's only one. A very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement. I really had trouble following the action.  So is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there's no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.\",\n",
       " b\"This film is genius. 11 years on this film is still the best Kevin Smith has done. I have countless examples of how universal this film is. Over the years I have found one constant. If you don't get it, you ARE clinically stupid. NO-ONE I have ever given this film to who likes it is stupid. I mean ALL races, ages & sexes. NOT one specific group, NOT geniuses, all types unified by the fact they're intelligent WITH passion & have a heart, because that's what Kevin Smith gets to, your heart. The dialogue, given in moments of calm, sucks you in because of its surrealism, its ability to provoke thought, its reflection of your own experience, and then hits you with some of the most laugh out loud, wet your pants, surreal comedy moments that you just don't expect and have ever seen. You care about the characters& recognise yourself in different ones. Above all the film doesn't make many absolute judgements. A few universal truths, which if are unrecognised mean you need to stop living with mummy&daddy and grow up, but mostly a lot of differing perspectives. The judgement is left to YOU because Smith doesn't patronise you as Hollywood does, you're treated as if your intelligence is respected and present, which is as acutely as I can put it as to why you ARE a pricking moron if you don't get it. If you are the elite of people who finds because of this film you are in the minority, you will then realise how many TRULY stupid people there are in the world. Any critic who slams a Kevin Smith film, well, you can forever ignore any review they give. Pity them, they ARE stupid. If you want to sort out which of your friends are idiots watch this film with them. And if YOU don't get it, well, the kindest I can put it is maybe you NEED to live some more, open your mind and heart a LOT more, then watch it again. PLEASE trust me, when you get it you will be justified in feeling a little smug for you will be stupid no-more.\",\n",
       " b'This short film from Lynne Ramsay is extremely impressive on a technical level as well as emotionally stirring. The director has an uncanny ability to capture those seemingly small and insignificant moments in a child\\'s life which have a lasting and profound effect; those moments when everything changes, innocence is lost and nothing will ever be the same again. The children in her films learn the facts of life the hard way and quite often have to make sense of them on their own without the aide of an understanding parent. I was more moved by \"Gasman\" than I was with \"Ratcatcher\" (her first feature length which is a must see for true film connoisseurs) for this reason. The director keeps information from the audience, so that when we discover what the little girl discovers it\\'s just as new and poignant for the viewer without being predictable. Lynne Ramsay is a true \"auteur\" who possesses the uncanny ability to capture beautiful and haunting moments of life.',\n",
       " b'Samuel L. Jackson, Milla Jovovich and the rest display fairly good acting throughout the entirety of the movie, but it seems almost as if the story was written on the fly. The bank rip-off seems pretty well thought through but everything after that just seems like crap, plotwise. On a positive note (at least for us guys) Milla Jovovich is particularly sexy in this movie in her wardrobe and brief Stockholm-syndrome-fling with Jackson. It still burns the hell out of me that Best Buy carries this DVD while Equilibrium was no where to be found.',\n",

There are other good stunts, and lots of action, and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings, but if for no other reason, you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt, then re-watch it in slow motion. It is incredible, and, despite the lower budget for this chapter play, Yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film \"Stagecoach.\" Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: This is the real deal!',\n",
       " b\"If you can get hold of this film it is well worth a look. Set in Scotland and telling the tale of a suicidal man whose life changes when he falls in love with single mother Shirley Henderson, it is both witty and sad in just the right measure. The love interest between the two leading characters is not straight forward and it is upon this dilemma that the film's plot revolves. Carefully directed, it never crosses the line into outright sentimentality although it does come dangerously close. Shirley Henderson is wonderful, as usual, but there are also strong performances from Jamie Sives and Adrian Rawlins. It is a low-key movie but a touching one that proves movies don't have to be violent, fast moving or steamy to entertain. Particularly suitable for lovers of kitchen sink romance.\",\n",

And which festivals are they? The film is okay if you compare it to films made by young teenagers. But given the age of those involved in this one, I would've expected more. Rather amateur on most levels except one. The only thing that really stands out is the concept of the film. Not the execution of the story or the film as a whole, just the concept by itself. So, if you put it up against very poor student short films, I guess I could see how it might stand out, with a decent concept that was captured.\",\n",

I don\\'t understand how he wrote this, the same guy who writes his stand-up routine, yet the movie is so poor. I didn\\'t laugh once. I went \"ha\" in one scene. Bob Franklin, Colin Lane and Shaun Micallef were totally wasted.  The movie is about a movie extra who wants to get a starring role so he can become a big star, become famous and become important. Problem is is that he\\'s a terrible actor and has lots of bad luck. Does he realise his dream? I\\'d say \"you have to see the movie\" but I don\\'t want you to get mad at me for wasting a couple of bucks hiring the DVD.  I admire him for giving the comedy movie a go, history shows Aussie\\'s have been terrible at making comedies (\"The Castle\" is excused), but maybe stick to the gags Jimeoin.

Dreamer is highly inspirational and the feeling you have once the film is over is unique. Its almost as if you can achieve your wildest dreams. This is by far one of my favourite movies.

The movie and the story is way to slow with barely any action involved and this is under the action section? The acting IMO wasn't that good at all and i like Colin Farrell. Pretty much the main stuff that makes this a bad movie is that it's too slow and the story is as well and doesn't make sense at all. It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough. So if i were you i would avoid this movie at all costs, even on free rental day. The only pro is the ending but that's it.\",\n",

Words cannot describe the lack of real plot (if there was suppose to be one) and the disjointed script. People who saw this tripe know what I am talking about.

It helped you build a person to person relationship with the character, rather then seeing her as a \\'mean\\' abused child it portrays her as just an abused child. You sort of take pity on her through this movie, rather then thinking she\\'s an evil spirit trying to raise hell. The actress who played Sadako was, what seemed to me, the only person that could play her. I felt they could\\'ve mixed in more suspense, and more thrills. That would have made for a better J-horror movie. It doesn\\'t compare to the movies brought out by Tartan Asia Exteme. Such as Tale of Two Sisters, Phone, (Memento Mori, Whispering Corridors, Wishing Stairs) a trilogy, Premonition, H, Oldboy, and many others.

Apart from having a supernatural aspect to it, it\\'s pretty much an after-school special sort of film. Its PG-13 rating isn\\'t even needed. The suicide element is so brief and tame, that this could still easily be rated G (remember, G doesn\\'t have to mean kids, it just means General Audiences). The interesting thing is that, when the credits finally rolled, I was satisfied with what I\\'d seen. Imagine that, a movie that doesn\\'t go for the kill and just wants to entertain you with a decent story for an hour or two. The script is...OK, the dialogue is... acceptable, the acting is good, for the most part (this movie is rife with underrated actors that are much more talented than they\\'ve ever been given credit for). What I find interesting is that everyone comes across as real people. Not \"good actors,\" just your regular, flawed bozos found on every street corner. When Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise are on a screen, you get drawn-in, but it\\'s always \"them.\" Marina Sirtis, on the other hand, makes you believe you\\'re watching a typical house-mom type, not an actress, who\\'s both kind and overbearing under different circumstances --just as a real person might be. There\\'s a scene towards the end that\\'ll have you wanting to give her a medal for realistically portraying someone in emotional agony, and not simply \"oh, the script says I\\'m supposed to scream here.\" So, overall it\\'s not a blockbuster, and it\\'s not something you\\'ll want to rush out and tell your friends about. Heck, some of the metaphysical/religious concepts used are so... well, let\\'s just say I don\\'t subscribe to them and politely leave it there, suffice to say they\\'re a bit corny and detracting, in an amalgamated \"I\\'ve read a lot of spiritual books, but don\\'t really know a thing about it\" sort of way. But, I gave this one an \"8\" score for one very good reason: It accomplished what it set out to do, and it did leave me happy that I\\'d watched it. With Hollywood pumping out multi-million dollar blockbusters with tons of FX and no story on a regular basis, how often can we really say that about a film these days?',\n",

       " b'Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods, not only in her career, but in her personal life too. After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. While she has recovered from that dark past, this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore\\'s worst days.  The movie starts with an interesting premise, very reminiscent to Brian De Palma\\'s \"Raising Cain\"; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror/thriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.  Suddenly, her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.  Unlike De Palma\\'s underrated thriller, \"Doppelganger\" is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it\\'s purpose, it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.  The script is full of clich\\xc3\\xa9s and De Palma\\'s influence is quite obvious. While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn\\'t do any good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, and excessive use of special effects.  The make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB\\'s work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.  The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for it\\'s low quality, as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie. Sadly, all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second. Worthy for Barrymore\\'s beauty. 3/10',\n",
       " b\"Enduring Love was directed by Robert Michell, Joe Penhall wrote the screenplay,adapting Ian McEwan's novel.  Daniel Craig,Rhys Ifans & Samantha Morton star in this rather strange drama. It starts off with a tragic accident, & one death. This part is very interesting, exciting & well done. This is the first 10 minutes of the film, then the remaining 90 minutes is all talking,(low key), It does get more dramatic towards the end. The script at times seems confusing, even though its mostly 2 or 3 people talking.  The talk is interesting (its about love & life). The acting is the main reason to see this film. Daniel Craig made this 2 years before he became James Bond. Here he is not as pumped up as he was in Casino Royale. He is an excellent actor & definitely handles this role very well, so does Samantha Morton & as his girl friend. Miss Morton is very talented.  The third character is Rhys Ifans, one of the newer actors & He will be a top draw performer very soon, (Think of a younger Christopher Walkin). Bill Nighy gives another delightful performance as he usually does.  This is a hard film to review for me: as much as I liked the acting, sets, locations etc. I found the story on the dull side.. my 3 star rating (below) is at the bottom of the 3 star range.  Its easy to see why this did not play in many theatres.(maximum of 50 in USA late 2004) Its R rating is mainly for the F word used throughout, BUT this is not a film for teens & younger.  Ratings: *** (out of4) 80 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)\",\n",

Otherwise, it's a plot less story about three and four way sexploits with the final few minutes dedicated to the premise of a shark horror flick. Unfortunately for me I had to sit through the whole thing as I had started it and it was too hot and windy to go outside. You do get ideas about how you'd like to have that much money so that you could live on a yacht without responsibility and the promise of toast after toast with your latest shag, but the continual slaughter of sharks, sea turtles and stingrays for a movie such as this leaves one filled with guilt.\",\n",

If you\\'re somehow reading this without having seen the film, then do yourself a large favour: rent it, or buy it.  It\\'s ironic that the production company of the \"quiet\", peaceful Beatle, George Harrison, should construct such a violent and gritty picture. Bob Hoskins is so perfect as an East-End ganglord that you wonder how he ever got cast out of character as a cod American acting opposite a cartoon rabbit. Is this really the same man who urged the virtues of conversation on behalf of a phone company? Hoskins acts more in the final two minutes of this movie than in the rest of his career put together.  What makes The Long Good Friday so special, (apart from stylish, but not ostentatious, direction and a superb theme score) is its variation on the typical crime theme. Instead of guns and bluster stretched out over an hour and forty minutes we get what is essentially a detective story. Who is planting bombs on Harold\\'s patch? Who is trying to undermine his organisation? And will Harold put the pieces together before the noose around his neck gets too tight? Admittedly, Sherlock Holmes never got his clues by stringing up Moriarty from his ankles in a meat factory, but the narrative principle is the same.  Is it really already the 20th anniversary of this film? What a timely reminder of how powerful the British Film Industry used to be. A must-see movie and quite excellent.',\n",

We know how you feel, Anakin. Am I the only one who thought this was actually worse than the Phantom Menace? I don\\'t remember anything about the plot of that film but I remember feeling mildly entertained. This was just plain boring. From the high-speed chase in the city to the weird tall thin aliens to the political assassination attempt it all felt like a TV spin-off of the Fifth Element without the famous actors, the beautiful models, the slick direction, the humour, the dialogue or the fun. The waterfalls in the background on Naboo looked like the tongue-in-cheek idyllic backdrop on a Kraftwerk CD. The gladiatorial scene was straight out of your first Dungeons & Dragons game. The big battle at the end was SO BORING people were leaving their seats and returning ten minutes later... they\\'d probably gone outside for a cigarette. The acting and the dialogue would, by and large, not have passed muster on a Mexican soap opera; the most interesting part of Natalie Portman\\'s performance was the surprise appearance of her nipples. On the plus side: Yoda drew some genuine laughs with his \"kung fu\" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a bit too fanciful for my liking. Ewan McGregor\\'s effort was good considering the material, and his fight with Jango Fett should put him in the running for a role as 007. But what this franchise really needs to do is bring back Harrison Ford... perhaps Han Solo was a clone?',\n",

To the contrary, the master of ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government (and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability). Furthermore, the elements conspire--in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic--to leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People (as the natives dub them) to close the story. If you happen to see the current release EARTH, you\\'ll detect the Elephant People are faring less well today.',\n",

Donald Sutherland (in a wooden, unlikable performance) plays Dan Candy, a member of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police who arrests an Indian for slaughtering a government alloted cow without prior approval. The Indian escapes and kills his partner.  Most of this excruciating movie consists of Sutherland walking into the woods, coming back empty-handed, and arguing with his superior officer.  There's no suspense and what little action there is (before the climax) consists mostly of pot shots taken by and against Indians on his various trips to the reservation.  Considering the talent involved, (Sutherland, Kevin McCarthy, Chief Dan George) this should have been good. I suggest you watch Thunderheart instead.\",\n",
       " b'G-MEN FROM HELL (2 outta 5 stars)  I *wanted* to like this movie, I really did... I\\'ve always been a great admirer of Mike Allred\\'s comic book work... and this movie was based on an early, odd strip of his. The movie is actually pretty faithful to the \"plot\" of the original... even down to the nonsensical appearance of a superhero known as \"Cheetah Man\". There are a lot of familiar names in the cast (William Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Paul Rodriguez... and Robert Goulet as the devil). The story is about a pair of overly-zealous FBI agents who die, get sent to hell and escape back to earth so that they can do some good deeds and earn a place in heaven. Sounds like fun... but it just doesn\\'t quite work. Director Christopher Coppola (yes, he\\'s related to all those other Coppolas... go figure) likes to frame everything in weird angles reminiscent of the old \"Batman\" and \"Monkees\" TV shows... but filming shots from odd angles doesn\\'t necessarily constitute a \"stylish\" film. The script doesn\\'t have much going for it... outside of a few good lines (most of which probably came from the comic). The acting is either lamely amatuerish... or is too wildly over-the-top... with the exception of Forsythe who does a pretty good deadpan, hard-boiled tough guy and Gary Busey as a weird, gay cop. Sure, Robert Goulet playing the Devil is a pretty cool idea... but I don\\'t think the execution exactly lives up to the promise. It\\'s a nice enough movie if you are really into wacky, low budget, cult comedies... but it all sounds better on paper than it actually looks onscreen.',\n",

Of course, the side show is filled with inbred freaks, who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves.  The only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors. Other than that, there's nothing worthwhile about the film.\",\n",

I thought that with Andy Lau and Rosamund Kwan in the film that it would be decent, but I should have expected to be as crappy as it was since it had Wong Jing in it.

Even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.  As for the car, well the DJ's comment at the end about the Challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (And if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though I didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.\",\n",

       " b\"This is a well-cast, well-directed, tightly-scripted film (only 87 minutes). The cast is amazing for what had to be a fairly low budget RKO picture from the mid-1950's; Randolph Scott was an established star while Forrest Tucker, J. Carrol Naish, and Denver Pyle were all established, talented Western performers and Edgar Buchanan was one of the best Western character actors of all time. What hurts the movie severely and is its major flaw is the setting. Nothing about one single shot of the film looks anything like Southern Indiana or anywhere else in the Midwest, and exactly like California, where it was actually shot. This lack of authenticity is distracting, in some scenes more than others, but never completely destroys the fine performances. Like some of the others, I would like to know more about the historical Reno Brothers and how closely this film represents their true story; I'm sure that it's somewhat closer than Elvis' ''Love Me Tender'', which is about the same topic and came out the next year.\",\n",

But then, you\\'d have nothing left to make a television show about.  This show is hardly the progressive step it pretends to be. It\\'s a step backward, and the core audience to whom this show is intended will see it for what it is in just one episode.',\n",
       " b\"In Europe, it's known as Who Dares Wins; in America, it's known as The Final Option, but under any title this ludicrous SAS action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours. I find it incredibly hard to comprehend how Lewis Collins (the hero here) was almost chosen as Roger Moore's successor in the Bond films.... this guy is so expressionless he'd struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum (as a waxwork!!!) Luckily, Judy Davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard-line lady terrorist, and there's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director Ian Sharp. Let it be added that it's a very, very, very long wait for these closing excitements to come around, and I can't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort.  SAS hard man Peter Skellen (Lewis Collins) goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock-piling. He meets their leader Frankie (Judy Davis), a strong-talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals. Frankie's dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the American Embassy in London, demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in Scotland (she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real, everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament). Unfortunately for Frankie, she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid, and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well-timed outside help from his SAS comrades.  The film is inspired - quite obviously - by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981. Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines. Unfortunately, the film is rather banal, with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes (the arch-bishop's debate which descends into a riot, anyone?) Frankie's idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway, so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain. Who Dares Wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the SAS, but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clich\\xc3\\xa9s and ill-thought-out plotting. The result is a well-intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of Boy's Own absurdity.\",\n",

Steve Gordon\\'s one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally \"unlikely\" if not quite \"impossible\" melding of wildly disparate elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is, in itself, wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his finest role, and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact, including the score, seems to me patent and egregious. I challenge ANYone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. But, apparently, nearly a third of its audience has so managed. Well, I, for one, found and find Gordon\\'s effort both laughable AND lovable, and the iikes of Geraldine Fitzgerald\\'s great-aunt and Stephen Elliott\\'s murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization, and the late, sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his fee, but wrong about undertaking his role. \"Arthur\" makes no effort to \"Underztand,\" much less rationalize, the scourge of \"alcoholism\" (hey, iFit ain\\'t booze, it\\'s other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are merely symptoms, not targets), it simply observes in its own quizzical manner.',\n",

       " b'\"D.E.B.S.\" is the interesting title of a film which just doesn\\'t seem to know what audience it\\'s trying to shoot for. (In case you were wondering, \"D.E.B.S.\" is an acronym for \"Discipline Energy Beauty Strength\") The film is definitely going to be a \\'head turner\\' not because it stars some very attractive actresses, but because of the \\'love-story\\' that sprouts between two of the lead female characters. Yes, you read right, two of the female characters turn out to be lesbians.  Now, there\\'s nothing wrong with lesbianism, but it seems as if it\\'s a very touchy subject that not too many people will understand, especially if they\\'re a bit more on the conservative side.  Nonetheless, that part of the movie is beside the point. It\\'s a comedy that tries it\\'s best to spoof the typical spy/action/adventure/thriller genre by adding it\\'s own humorous twists to it.  There were some moments where I actually laughed a little bit, but the moments where I did laugh were due to some of the audience members saying funny things (No, the movie did not make me laugh in the least bit). Overall, the movie left a lot to be desired in terms of storyline. The humor of the movie was not even along the lines of quality similar to a \\'Naked Gun\\' or \\'Airplane\\', but some sort of generic type of humor which tries too hard to please many audiences.  The one thing that did surprise me were the special effects. There were some pretty interesting visuals that caught my attention, especially for being kind of original. (Most notably being The \"force field\" and \"laser trip wires\" around the D.E.B.S.\\' house/dorm and the \"hologram\" technology that the Directors of the D.E.B.S. use frequently throughout the film) Will the male viewers like this film? Yes, because there are some very attractive \\'eye candy\\' actresses starring in it, some of whom also end up locking lips at several points (I won\\'t spoil that part for you). But, that\\'s where it\\'s going to stop for most male movie-goers.  Will the female viewers like this film? Yes, not only because there are many humorous references that only females would truly understand (I\\'ll be honest, I didn\\'t laugh at some of the \\'jokes\\' because they were probably intended for the female viewers. I\\'m a male.), but because there\\'s a certain amount of plot that only female viewers can really latch on to.  Genders aside, will the distinguished movie-goer like this film? NOT A CHANCE. Think of this film as a type of \"Spy Kids\" movie, but only aimed at the 16-30 audience base. This is also a film that most parents should NOT let their younger children watch, due to the various adult themes. (Note for parents: You think it\\'s difficult to explain \"The Birds & The Bees\" to your young ones? Try explaining the idea of homosexuality to your youngsters.) I highly doubt that this movie will make anything close to $20 Million, given the fact that it has a touchy subject that most of the conservative folks will try to bash upon. Even if it didn\\'t have that \\'shocking twist\\' (lesbianism), this movie would STILL be a garbage-throw away-not-even-average film. (I will give it this much though; At least it\\'s not a film directed by Uwe Boll. *UGH*) I\\'m glad I didn\\'t have to pay to see this movie. (Free preview tickets rule!) I would have felt so ripped off if I did pay. Then again, I probably wouldn\\'t have even wanted to see this movie if I did have to pay. This film certainly wasn\\'t on my \"Must See\" list for 2005, that\\'s for sure.',\n",
       " b\"I feel the need to post a comment on this title because I've seen a few comments from people who are surprised at the positive user response for such an awful show.  What is truly tragic about Andromeda is that it is a show that never realized its full potential. This is due to the powers that be and their decision to remove Wolfe from his post as head writer of the show.  From Season 1 to the halfway point of Season 2, Wolfe was the head writer of Andromeda and the show was quality in every sense of the word. Wolfe took his experience from shows such as Star Trek: Deep Space Night and invested it in Andromeda, bringing life to intricate plot-lines and vibrant characters functioning in a realized Universe.  As Season 2 began to move along, the usual first season clumsiness that one expects from new TV shows had totally dissolved and an epic plot line was beginning to come to life.  This was tragically cut short when Wolfe was fired. After this unfortunate event, nearly all of his work was thrown out of the window as the series took an entirely different direction in favour of mainstream approval and a more episodic format. The most painful example of the latter is embodied in the decision to do away with the character of Trance in favour of a new incarnation of the character designed to be sexy.  The series began to spiral downwards even more, until it was finally too difficult to watch. Andromeda soon began to buy into nearly every science fiction clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the book, and when it ended was a pathetic worm of its former glory.  Four stars out of ten for 1.5 excellent seasons and 3.5 awful ones in a show that tragically never met its unimaginable potential.\",\n",

Where the troubled history between Verdegast and Poelzig comes to light and thus spells immense danger for the newly married Allison's.  Excellently directed by Ulmer, The Black Cat still today has the ability to genuinely unnerve the viewer. Filled with an overwhelming sense of dread throughout, Ulmer and his on form leading men have crafted a superb study of character evil. Flanked by a magnificent set design and with a script that does Poe proud, the piece pot boils until its brutal and frenzied climax. Karloff and Lugosi are particularly impressive {check out the chess match sequences}, lending the film its timeless quality, with Karloff's Poelzig apparently being based on real life occultist Aleister Crowley. While the music, featuring some of the biggest names of classical composition, is an extra haunting character all by itself. It's a far from flawless picture, but it remains a unique, literate and important film in the pantheon of classic horror. 7/10\",\n",
       " b'For months I\\'ve been hearing about this little movie and now I\\'ve seen it. I find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people\\'s creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood\\'s door then they\\'re doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase, \"It\\'s Animal House meets Back to the Future\"; \"It\\'s Wall Street meets Dead Poet\\'s Society\"; or \"Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars\"? I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable.',\n",
       " b\"the acting in this is remarkable. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton are flawless in this. directed and produced by the Coen brothers, so knowing all that you all know your in for a treat. the brothers have made better films but this is far from there worst. now for everyone of you that have seen the trailer to this and got the impression that its a laugh a minute film that you can watch with all your friends, its not. yes it is pretty funny but it has a fairly complex story to it. now i hope by saying that i don't give the impression that i'm discrediting the film but the funny parts in the trailer are about the only funny parts in the film. but i didn't want to watch this film for the humour. i wanted to watch it for the big cast in it plus the directors. this film is very well made by them. everyone should see this film .......8/10.....j.d Seaton\",\n",
       " b'On watching this film I was struck by the timelessness of its message and its continued relevance today. Most surprising to me was that it was made/shown in 1950, but it could easily have been made today. I\\'m actually rather angry that I had to stumble across this film by accident online, instead of seeing it on any of the numerous gay and short film channels or festivals. It deserves to be seen.  A lot of comments have been written noting its supposed \"surrealism\" and \"metaphor\". While that\\'s all well and good, this is quite simply a straightforward and common story of prison loneliness (Kiss of the Spider Woman), homophobic oppression by a closet case (Outrage 2009/II), and love winning over all. Newsflash: Just because it\\'s gay doesn\\'t mean it\\'s mysterious.  The only things preventing me from giving this film the full 10 ... umm ... points, are some jumpy editing, and the fact that both prisoners are knocking on their shared wall, but they are shot from the same angle so it looks like they are knocking on different walls.',\n",
       " b'While many of the porn films during this era still tried to have something resembling a plot, few were as out there as CURSE OF THE CATWOMAN. A riff on the old CAT PEOPLE flicks, this has a group of people who can apparently turn into big cats living it up at clubs. Selena Steele is at her best here, Rocco Sifredi (in an early role) doesn\\'t say much (which is good. As long as he\\'s only around to provide his extraordinary \"talent\" he\\'s not irritating), and Patricia Kennedy is at her hottest. The scene of Rocco and Kennedy going at it in bed while Steele sleeps next to them is a scorcher, and the best of the film.',\n",
       " b\"Don't get me wrong by the suummary as I enjoyed this movie very much. Bernhardt plays an ex-Navy SEAL who is forced to murder a corporate executive after the Yakuza kidnap his daughter. Their is a subplot involving Bernhardt and the Yakuza boss...oh, and Naval Intelligence and the local police are after him, too! Gunfights, fistfights and a slam-bang ending make this a watchable film. Bernhardt definitely has the looks and talent to become the next action star. Check him out in Bloodport 2, 3 & 4, MK: Conquest (on TV) or watch for him in the upcoming Matrix sequels!\",\n",
       " b'OK, OK, I can understand how some movies try to use womanly figures to promote their movies and give some cheap thrills to the male audience, but you have to begin questioning a film that has the main lead getting it on with the first two nameless bare breasted chicks he rescues.   But that\\'s not what makes the movie bad, nay painful. The script was a disaster and the delivery of said script was a travesty in the art of character portrayal. That being said, the characters in need of portrayal were shallow, one dimensional stereotyped fantasy figures and overused to the extent of being nauseous, so the actors can\\'t take all of the blame.  The worst part of the movie occurs with the introduction of the \"cute little sidekick\" in the form of the abomination named Wooby. It is some mix between an Ewok and a giant teddy bear but shares none of the admirable qualities of either. The costume looks like it was a halloween costume thrown out by a 10 year old who knew better. The fight scenes involving Wooby are equally ridiculous and are little more than the light tossing of stones that plink of the chests of the bad guys but somehow manage to do enough damage to kill or otherwise disable them.  The only redeemable quality of the movie is O\\'Hearn himself, but not because of his acting ability or skill with martial arts and clearly not for his theatrical fighting abilities. The sole benefit he gives to the movie is that he looks the part and looks it well. The plot is overly clich\\xc3\\xa9 and reminiscent of fourteen year olds playing Dungeons and Dragons and the film doesn\\'t even take itself seriously enough NOT to steal footage from other movies. Yes, an entire scene was taken right out of \"DeathStalker\".  The movie was a disaster and rivaled only by the likes of films such as Time Bandits and Cave Dwellers.  And for goodness sakes, it has Wooby.',\n",
       " b\"It's never a good sign when the DVD costs just \\xc2\\xa31 and comes in one of those very thin cases. Neither is it when there's just the bald title printed on the disc and there's no additional material. Still; we live in hope...  Well; what you see is what you get. Don't be fooled by Roland Emerich's name amongst the credits; this is truly a C-movie.  The plot goes something like this. Uninhabited worlds in deep space are being mined for minerals. The stuff is then taken away in shuttle-craft to planetary processing plants. This makes the shuttles extremely valuable and somebody is hijacking them. An undercover cop is sent to find out what's going on, by joining a prison-team at the next world most likely to be targeted. That's 'Moon 44'.  Like so many of these cheap (and not so cheap) movies, money seems to have been saved by not employing a lighting facility. And everything happens in an often barely discernible gloom - even indoors. The twilight never lifts from the beginning to end, making for an extremely dull and claustrophobic experience. Actors are almost all B or C-list and they are doomed to struggle with a script that might be politely described as lacking intelligence. Even the 'big catch' of an ageing Malcolm Macdowell from 'A Clockwork Orange' fame, fails to illuminate either the set or the script.  There's so many silly things going on as regards the plot that it sometimes appears as if children had drafted it. Macdowell's the boss/baddie on the moon, but we never know who he's working for. It's clearly not himself as there's a big battle-cruiser turns up to launch an attack on the moon. Where from? Who's in it? Where does it go? Who cares - clearly not Mr Emmerich. Criminals are sent as defence pilots. They fly helicopters along smoke-filled canyons. Why? why not gain altitude and be a helluva lot safer? Weapons systems are actually more primitive than those available today. Apaches (attack helicopters) employ 8 'Hellfire' guided missiles with a range of up to 5 miles. These defenders didn't engage the enemy within 1000 yards.  On top of all this, there's a testosterone-sodden bi-line about these violent scum-of-the-earth criminals (who are yet still exceptional enough to be qualified helicopter pilots) that makes 'Shawshank' seem like a holiday-camp. This is needlessly emphasised by a shower-scene rape. Ironically, the rapist chooses to rape his land-based navigator, the one man upon whom he will have to depend in the foggy valleys, and it never occurs to him that this geezer might take revenge. Yes.  Bought as a piece of cheap Friday-night throwaway hokum, it was in the charity shop by Saturday afternoon.\",\n",
       " b\"When Lucille Ball was an acclaimed, but not very widely known B picture actress, Joan Davis was winning a lot more acclaim for her own brand of goofy physical humor on radio and on film. She was a mainstay of support to a lot of the glamor girls and guys at 20th Century Fox.   A long term extra marital affair with Eddie Cantor helped push her career along as Cantor featured her on radio and had her co-star in two of his films.  Like so many players when the motion picture studios started cutting down production and leaving people out of work, Davis turned to television. Unfortunately one year too late to get credit for originality.  Lucille Ball and her real life husband beat her to the tube by a year. They put on a very successful situation comedy about a wacky wife with an exasperated husband that we all know about.  So when Joan Davis debuted I Married Joan in 1952 she was accused of copying Lucy. Not so as any viewing of her films will so demonstrate.  But Lucy was there first and got the deserved credit.   I Married Joan was a very funny show that trailed in the wake of I Love Lucy. It ended in 1955 because her TV husband Jim Backus quit the show. As Judge Bradley J. Stevens, he was her exasperated straight man of a husband. He'd get to show his comic flair later on in Gilligan's Island.  Sad that Joan Davis was never able to develop another television show to show her talent before she died.  A very funny lady, with a very funny show.\",\n",
       " b'This movie, despite what many reviewers seem to think, is about the differences between men and women with respect to sex and love. Whether it is with Oscar and Mimi\\'s intense, wild, no holds barred relationship, or with boring, bland Nigel and Fiona.  Generally speaking, men can have sex with any amount of women, in any way or intensity. If she is up for it, chances are we will be too. Women on the other hand, require more of an emotional connection to the men they sleep with. The need to develop trust and comfort before completely letting go.  Oscar is the ultimate poon hound and became instantly infatuated with Mimi. They start with a normal passionate relationship, but ultimately, the excitement wears off. This happens in any and every relationship. They hike up the intensity by getting into bondage, S&M, etc. All the while, Oscar is all to aware, they are heading for the their peak and once it hits the top, it is only down hill from there.  The thing is, for the man in this case, it is only about the sexual passion. The woman is truly in love and the sex is the connection to her man. Even when the sexual excitement wears off, Mimi is still in love.  So, enter the conflict. Oscar is done, wants out. Mimi can\\'t handle it and doesn\\'t understand why he could possibly not love her the way she loves him. He tries to be compassionate and break up but she refuses to be let go, ultimate agreeing to be his slave just to stay near him.  This story is being told to a couple who have also been together for 7 years and are off to reignite their marriage. I believe that the same factors are in play with the stuffy British couple, Nigel and Fiona but only in a far more repressed manner. He\\'s bored because he and his wife are doing the \"normal\" thing. No wild, kinky sex for them. But the emotion of love is there. If a couple is going to stay together forever, they simply have to get over the fact that physical passion is fleeting and if the bond of love is strong on both sides, they can make it work. Nigel isn\\'t clear on this until the climactic ending.  This commentary isn\\'t so much on the details of the plot, but what I believe the movie is trying to get across. Read the other posts for more details, but to understand what the movie is saying, understand that sex is sex for men and sex is love for women.',\n",
       " b'I gave this movie a 9, but I don\\'t rate movies in the usual fashion. I don\\'t think horror movies should be rated against all other types, just themselves. It\\'s a much more raw form of entertainment and it often fails to deliver. I think the director, Paul Anderson, summed it up effectively in this quote, \"We tried to put into the movie that constant sense of dread and foreboding. As you play the game, as you\\'re walking around, you\\'re terrified as to what might happen next. That\\'s the kind of tone of the movie.\" He is correct. I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband\\'s left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick. I may be biased in that I feel there is no other concept scarier than zombies-beings whose ONLY objective is to kill you by eating you. Very loudly. Ewww. I have never played the games, since I\\'m a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had. I asked him what the plot was to get a feel for whether or not it was an accurate depiction. He had very VAGUE ideas about the plot. I was able to fill in the blanks. I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up. I believe it only makes the movie better. Sure there are one-liners that aren\\'t stellar, but it IS horror. You have to expect a little cheese with your flick. I honestly don\\'t think the ending could\\'ve been any better. I was very entertained. If you check out my other reviews though, I\\'m no major critic. I go to the movies to be entertained, and I usually pay matinee price, as I did that day. I can\\'t say I would\\'ve loved it as much if we paid 6 more bucks to get in. As I always say, sit back and relax. It\\'s just entertainment.',\n",

Its really a big screen version of the now-classic Playstation game RE 3.It takes place right after the first.Things start out okay.We're introduced to Alice,Jill,Carlos,Nemisis,etc.But after the opening 10 minutes it is all downhill from there.  For starters why give Alice Super powers?It takes away from the first movies realism,makes her shallow,and a grade z matrix wannabe.The stakes go from high to low.Whereas the first you never knew who was gonna live or die.Where is the tension?  The Nemisis is kinda fun to watch.They got him right.But even he is sabotaged by the random shots that reveal him to be an over-sized Stuntman in a rubber suit.A competent director would know to shoot around this.Even the Roger Corman cheapies know how to do that on a tenth of this flicks budget.  Where are the zombies?For the most part they are again sabotaged by the director,who keeps them out of focus most of the time.Its like they are ashamed to say this is a horror flick?  Where is the freaking logic here?The characters do the stupidest things?There is some howling dialog here.Its hard to sustain interest upon hearing what comes out of the cast mouth.Why the hell would they bring a kid along on a rescue attempt?The action sequences resemble MTV videos from 1986.  Milla is okay as Alice.I would watch her in a soup commercial.But she comes off as really pompous here.Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr are about the only ones that come off well in RE 2.Mike Epps,Thomas Kretschmann,and Jared Harris are wasted here.The cast all come off as kind of smug in my book,and its hard to like them.  The directing,scripting,and visuals all look terrible here.I don't wanna be hard on Witt.But I would have went with Anyone else but him. I suspect its not all his fault though.I was never part of the I-hate-Anderson-crowd.But I think the fault here lies with him and the producers.He ruined AVP.Now this!I think he owes me 20 bucks now for paying to see the combined dreck that is AVP and RE2.In the same year no doubt!!!  RE2 held a lot of promise that has sadly been flushed down the proverbial toilet.Ever more cringing is the fact that a RE3 is on the way.\",\n",

It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the \"angel\" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy \"ice\" maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now, one year later, Henry\\'s sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fianc\\xc3\\xa9 and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema.',\n",
       " b'Peter Jackson has a big heart, I think. Even for all the gore and grossness of his films (i.e.; Dead Alive aka Braindead) he always has a very heartfelt moment of sentiment. In this film, it\\'s the loving way McKenzie is treated and the seriousness of his death scene, captured on film. While much of the film has very tongue in cheek chuckles, this part is played very seriously.  Also, as someone who works every day with \"forgotten silver\", I admire his treatment of the whole subject. For, while McKenzie and his films may be bogus, the plight of old movies is not. I\\'m amazed at how much footage shows up in attics and basements and garden sheds every year. In just the eight months so far of 1999, we have received at least 30 \"new\" films; rare and unique items all. And we have films done by people very much like Colin McKenzie. Private, personal projects, most of which never saw the light of day or vanished quickly after their initial release. So much \"forgotten silver.\"',\n",

This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives.

Send a message to Paris, don\\'t buy her products or tune in. Trash like this is worse than \"The Apprentice\" because it has six year old kids, tuning in and thinking its \"cool\".

This is easily the most appalling release from Full Moon yet. Words cannot express how lousy (and irritating) this load of excrement is. Frankly, it's insulting that it received ANY kind of release and that anyone has to be tricked into suffering through someone else's home movie. I could even forgive the nonexistent budget, amateurism and awful make-up if there was something else of merit going on here (no such luck!). What I cannot forgive is the completely unfunny 'script' (granted it had one), the migraine-inducing overacting and the pitiful name dropping at each and every turn (I could list fifty other major annoyances, but I won't...) Chris Seaver has absolutely no discernible talent, but HE obviously disagrees with me. Listen to the commentary track and you'll hear the rantings of one of the most misguided, idiotic and delusional people on the planet. He seems to fancy himself as such an original talent. So Chris, I'm glad you find yourself to be so very witty and talented. I found you to be a smug, annoying, juvenile and irrelevant moron whose only possible fan base would have to consist of not-so-bright 10 year olds or someone borderline retarded.

Now, you all may think I\\'m just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for Shakespeare or \"artistic film-making\"... well, you\\'d be wrong on both counts. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I\\'ve watched plenty of \"arthouse\" films such as the surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini\\'s 8 1/2... but this was just over two hours of lost-in-translation Shakespeare, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in SOME scenes... but not in every other shot of a movie!!! IT WAS POINTLESS AND SERVED NOTHING FOR THE STORY!!!), and basically just overzealous film-making. I had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be \"very artistic\" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest... but this was just an extreme letdown. I gave this film a three ONLY because of Sir John Gielgud\\'s acting presence (which far surpassed all of the no-names in this film) and the cinematography/set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion... however, a lot of this film would\\'ve been better off as JUST a painting with a scroll of text below it. A true disappointment... maybe if Zeffirelli had been given the director\\'s chair, this would\\'ve been much better. But this is one audience member\\'s opinion, many others may enjoy this far more than me.

Filmed at Universal, the story goes that the company balked when Hatton\\'s disfiguring disease killed him before the film could be released and they sold it to PRC. I\\'d like to think that they sold it because the film wasn\\'t good and the disease story makes them sound more \"caring\". Lets face it this film is a turkey. Its mostly Hatton stalking through the night for the first half while the police, played with less than all seriousness try to catch him. Its dull and makes you wonder if they removed ten minutes at the start. The second half with the blind girl is so incredibly soapy as to be laughable. Its a really dumb movie that is notable only for it being Hatton\\'s final role.

The unfortunate thing is that nothing terribly exciting happens despite the effort to make this some sort of mystery. Aside from a little mood, the only things going on here of passing interest are some slapstick (Glenn Strange plays an imbecile who falls down the stairs; the young girl\\'s angry father slaps her would-be bridegroom across his face) and some humorous dialogue (a favorite is Zucco\\'s scolding of Strange: \"With your imagination, you could see the Statue of Liberty do the conga!\").

This movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.With the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.I've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (BTK movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.We watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.If anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. The entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked.\",\n",
       " b\"I watched this show with trepidation expecting it to be another hit and miss, or even plain miss, of a mini-series. I was more then pleasantly suprised when the show proved not only to be hilarious but a much needed break from the vapid 'reality' shows that have come to expunge any palatability from our viewing pleasure. The 'bad acting', or 'showing the truth' as Garth puts it, is amazingly funny. This is especially true in the character of Garth's boss and the chef (The Office's Stephan Merchant). Overall, it can tend to be a bit tedious by the end but at the moment it is hysterical and I can't wait to see where they go from here.\",\n",
       " b'About three minutes into this thing I started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). In ten minutes I was done, and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy\\'s remote control! That\\'s the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the \"twist\" at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.  This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away!',\n",
       " b\"Okay...this is not a perfect movie, and it is hard to categorize because it is not violent enough for today's action movie label, funny enough for today's comedy tag or serious enough to earn the drama moniker.  We also have to realize that this is early in the career of some of the performers. Helen Hunt, liam Neeson, Ben Stiller and Bill Paxton are big today, but you cannot measure this movie by today's standards.  What a lot of people seem to have missed here is the theme about family and friendships. You had the hillbilly vs. the mob family -- hard to compare -- not really. The movie accented that their were more similarities than differences. There are too many examples to be worth singling any of them out.  You also had the loyalty/friendship theme. Think of how Michael J. Pollard, living in the basement of society, had high morals, or how the guys in the hillbilly bar could family up. You could measure that to the members of the bosses crime family against the character of Adam Baldwin.  All in all, this is not a great movie...good at best. But there are some interesting points worth pondering. And seeing an Irishman, Liam Neeson, playing a classic redneck hillbilly is worth seeing it all by itself.  Finally...another overlooked part of this movie is the excellent soundtrack. It is among my small collection of movie soundtracks, that should sum it.\",\n",

       " b\"I was as excited as a child on Christmas Eve as I made my way to the Cinema to watch this brand new Australian 'Comedy'. All I can say was, whilst the 'actors' tried hard, and an honorable mention is given to 'Benny G' (played by Glenn Robbins), they failed to get more than a handful of laughs from the entire audience.  Constant errors in the dialog, strange and rather improbable plot structures and a lack of a genuine sense of humor ruined this film - one which had so much potential, and was bandied around the Australian television and radio airwaves as a potential Aussie classic.  The script was poor, and when a more humorous part of the film occurred, it was quickly wiped away by overkill. I came away struggling to find any positives from this film, which at only 88 minutes in duration, was hardly even one of those 'worth the money' experiences.  Give the film ago if you have nothing better to do with just under 1 and a half hours, otherwise, wait until it hits the local video store shelves, and gaze at the cover of something that could have been, should have been, but stumbled terribly short of the mark.\",\n",

       " b\"Utter piece of trash, I can't believe I actually watched it all the way to the end. Speaking of the ending, I have to admit I didn't see it coming. Probably because I stopped paying close attention after ten minutes. I won't spoil it for you, but hopefully you won't ever be watching this c - - p. Reading the back of a cereal box would have been a better use of time than watching this movie.  That said, there are a few fascinating things about this movie. There is, of course, the obvious: fascinatingly bad direction, writing and acting. The other is, where did they find actors with mouths this big? I mean, honest, they all make Julia Roberts' mouth look petite. You can't help but just watch these people talk... it's like watching alien lifeforms. I notice on some of the cast's filmographies here on IMDb they've done nothing much else but this movie. Thank God. We've all been spared. I hope the director and scriptwriter realize they ought to be selling real estate and stay out of the movie business.\",\n",
       " b\"I can probably go on for days telling what is wrong with this movie. The movie starts out with the descendats of the planet Krypton living undersea. The movie does not explain how come Krypton people,who call themselves Argonanians, are living undersea. The next thing you know Supergirl loses the Argonanian power source (a crystal ball) and chases the crystal ball to Earth. Meanwhile Selena(Faye Dunway) using black magic and the power source tries to take over the world. Now Supergirl posing as college student Linda Lee makes friend with Jimmy Olson, and Lucy Lane, niece of Lois Lane. I lost track during the movie why Selena needed the power source to take over the world, but frankly towards the end of the movie I couldn't care. I was upset that producers did not have the decency to bring Superman or Lois Lane. Faye Dunway's acting in this movie is terrible, the only part of the villian Selena, Ms. Dunway got correct is the appearance. Dunway looks awful in this movie i.m.h.o. The only good part is 10 minute scene with Helen Slater and Peter O'Toole towards the conclusion, but even O'Toole acting skills can't save this film. My recommendation is that this movie is a cure for insomnia.\",\n",
       " b\"I found this movie by happy accident when looking for another title at Video Vault. What a fortunate find, an excellent Middle Ages romp made by multi-Oscar master filmmaker Frank Lloyd.  Dealing with a fictional encounter between Louis XI of France and a rouge Villain, these two roles are wonderfully played by Ronald Colman and Basil Rathbone --- possibly the best roles these two great actors ever did. With Paris surrounded by the army of the Dukes of Burgundy and slowly being starved into submission, the king's plans are falling short of success --- with battle-shy generals and no back-up plan. Into this mess comes the rogue Villain with a different approach......  There isn't a dull minute in this fine production and the reproduction of French architecture, costumes, et cetera, is beyond perfect.  It isn't easy to see this movie; it's a Paramount Picture released on VHS long ago by Universal/MCA. That means you can find it eventually, either at a specialty video store or by tenacious search on eBay.\",\n",
       " b\"As a fan of Will Ferrell-style comedy (and I've loved Reilly in other movies), as well as a fan of the Johnny Cash and Ray Charles biopics, I thought mixing the two couldn't go wrong. I was horribly disappointed. Almost every joke was completely predictable \\xc2\\x96 you could see the punchline coming from a mile away, and when it arrived, it wasn't very funny. About the only thing good in this movie was Tim Meadows, who had me howling every time he was on screen (he's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one). If my daughter hadn't been in the next theater watching a movie with her aunt, I would have walked out and gone home.\",\n",
       " b\"My experience of films with a male gay theme is very limited having only seen Hollywood's most recent output before Les Temoins. It is a film that I found both refreshing and pleasantly surprising in the way in which it approaches and represents a physical gay relationship. Sex is shown to be sensitive and loving. It shows such a versatile tenderness from both parties and Sami Bouajila's performance as the character of Mehdi evokes such genuine feelings that I was moved to tears. In addition to this, I found Les Temoins an extremely beautiful film to watch visually, its very blue and yellow colour-scape providing a serene backdrop for the action. For someone looking for a much gentler yet highly gripping tale of gay love this is a film I would highly recommend.\",\n",
       " b\"I don't what that other review was talking about. This definitely isn't a bimbo movie, in fact, I don't think there was one decent looking girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, poorly-done, Ed Wood-style science fiction schlock. And it's bad. I can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night on cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. To me though, the music tops it all. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch it. You'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.\",\n",
       " b\"Every once in a while, you see a movie so dull and so stupid, you have to wonder if drugs were somehow involved in making the film. 'Exposed' is one of those films.  The plot of this film doesn't unravel, it oozes like molasses in January. Nastassja Kinski plays a Wisconsin farm girl named Elizabeth who leaves home and runs away to New York. After being discovered by a fashion photographer (McShane) she is whisked away into the glamorous world of fashion. Soon she's in Europe, and is recruited by a mysterious violin player (the awful corpse-like Rudolf Nureyev) to infiltrate a terrorist organization and kill it's leader. The leader is played by Harvey Keitel, who is given next to nothing to do.  The only good scene is at the very beginning when two terrorist babes blow up a Parisian restaurant. But it all goes downhill from there. In more capable hands and with a better cast, this film could have been good. But everything is a mess. The script is convoluted and boring, the acting is atrocious, the direction is flat, there is no suspense, and no characters that seem even human.  Oddly, so many people seem to praise Nastassja Kinski as a great actress. I've just never seen it. In every film I've seen her in she just seems vacant and bored, but this is Kinski at her worst, no doubt.\",\n",
       " b'Okay so maybe I\\'m a wimp or maybe I had legitimate medical reasons for fainting, but the fact is I do watch tons of horror films, volunteer regularly for a horror magazine, and this has never happened before. I should have fainted to Ichi the Killer, or Brain Dead, or f*ck, even the cockroach sequence in Creepshow- but no, the segment to knock me out was \"The girl with the golden breasts\" which was a story about this gorgeous chick who\\'s boob implant goes horribly wrong. Following the episode I went to the doctor, got a blood test, EKG, had my blood pressure taken, a full out exam- and was told that I was probably dehydrated, my body type is lean and more susceptible. I was working crazy hours, attending midnight screenings, the theater was stuffy, and blah blah blah. I\\'m a guy who writes horror scripts! I\\'ve become jaded as a writer because I\\'ve found it increasingly hard to scare myself. I\\'d like to think I\\'m tougher than that, but damn. The feeling came on like dimensional twist- like I was fighting to stay in my body- my perspective was pulsing, disorientation followed, then the unfightable desire to go and splash some water on my face. I should have stayed in my seat. Instead, I went out to the lobby, came crashing down- busted open my eyebrow...and have no memory of the fall. To preserve my dignity- and see if it really was an epileptic thing, I attended the second screening, and am happy to say I survived- didn\\'t faint or feel feverish throughout all the five stories, and enjoyed it quite a bit. I am totally into exploitation horror movies, and this one has plenty of it-- Though I would have liked to have seen more gore- the squeamish parts could have been expanded, made more sadistic, especially in the tape worm story-- the film as a whole reminded me of those old pulp EC horror comics I used to read as a kid. The lighting had echoes of Argento\\'s Suspiria... The main score was effectively creepy, the director\\'s styles were pretty varied adding some interesting textures to the whole, and I hope the people at Tales from the Crypt scoop up this team for another go at it- this time adding takashi miike to the roster to go full out into the lactating boob horror.',\n",
       " b'This movie can only be viewed as some sort of \"what not to do when shooting a movie\". The constant cutting and shifting leaves one feeling physically ill. I watched this movie with another person and we both experienced the same symptoms. A headache, strained eyes and eventually a strong urge to throw up.  The pity was that this movie was kinda promising. There is probably a big market out there for a satire of this kind demonstrating the type of spin that goes into publishing a red-top. However the director doesn\\'t seem to want to do that and the end product is a 100 minute music video.  The acting was also pretty dire, having wondered \"whatever happened to Jennifer Jason Leigh\" for the first few minutes of this movie, I soon realised why i hadn\\'t missed her.  The final nail in the coffin though had to be the resolution. Absolutely awful, I have never seen such and obvious attempt at a directorial get out of jail card.',\n",
       " b'good movie, although sometimes its hard to see the subtitles. the movie is about a priest who finds a secret message in the book of revelation, the day the anti-christ will be born. this movie is well paced and interesting. this movies interpretation of the devil is that of baphomet, a god the templar knights worshipped that priests accused of being the devil, though adapted by satanists to be used as the devil (search on the internet for baphomet and you can find a picture) throughout the movie alot of cult sybols are shown such as the pentagram and the eye of horus, showing that the director did at least a bit of research, they also mention a few bands at the beginning, one of them being iron maiden, and they play with the belief that a record played backwards can contain secret messages, but kind of mock it.anyway i would recommend this film to anyone interested in horror/mock horror/ or movies about the apocalypse/satan. the only problem i have with this movie is the ending is too clear for this kind of movie, it should have left the audience thinking about what happened.',\n",
       " b'A wonderful Czech classic that can be seen over and over! In my opinion, this is a film that is best understood if you are a native Czech, appreciate Czech humor and character, and like Bohumil Hrabal\\'s \"tender barbarian\" style of writing. It is not so much a movie about a local brewery director, his wife and their life in the brewery that strives to be an utterly funny comedy, as it is a lovely view of Hrabal\\'s parents, his unique uncle Pepin, and the times of \"cutting it short\", that brings a smile to your face and keeps it there for the duration of the film. I can understand that Postriziny can be very hard for non-Czech viewers to appreciate.',\n",
       " b'I\\'m usually pretty forgiving when it comes to romantic comedies, especially those out of Hollywood. They often are borderline insipid, clich\\xc3\\xa9d, predictable, and dull-witted, but those that aren\\'t completely inept still manage to entertain to varying degrees. Unfortunately, \"My Mom\\'s New Boyfriend\" falls way below the grade and fails even at being mildly amusing.  First, it isn\\'t necessary for a movie like this to be smart or particularly realistic, but it should have some integrity so that we can actually believe in the characters. Here, in the prologue, we see Henry Durand (Colin Hanks), who clearly has a close relationship with his Mom, Marty (Meg Ryan), leaving home and Mom behind to start a job with the FBI. Flash forward three years, and Henry returns home -- apparently, without even once having visited or talked to his Mom in all that time. Now I\\'m sure the FBI requires a certain amount of secrecy, but it sure doesn\\'t require its agents to cut off all communication with their nearest and dearest for three years. Right off the bat, the phoniness of the set-up sinks any chance at viewer empathy with any of the characters.  Second, the characters themselves are about the most unlikeable I can think of in any romantic comedy I\\'ve ever seen. I\\'d rather spend a weekend locked in a cell with Barbara Stone (Bette Midler\\'s character in \"Ruthless People\") than 15 minutes with the insufferably egotistical, vapid Marty Durand. Ryan is just awful here, and I usually enjoy her performances. She badly overplays Marty\\'s zany qualities with ticks and vocal histrionics that are way over-the-top, and she seems to have lost whatever limited gifts she had for physical comedy. Maybe the knife slipped and the surgeons cut something else out when they were redesigning her face. She looks like she\\'s trying to look like Michelle Pfeiffer and failing miserably. It has to be the worst performance of her career, and probably the worst of the year. Hanks, perhaps trying to counterweight Ryan\\'s annoying performance, is as lifeless as a paperweight. He glowers and scowls through the film. Neither Antonio Banderas nor Selma Blair have enough to do to make much of an impression, though Banderas manages at least to be somewhat charming through the muddle of the storyline. Actually, the only genuinely funny performance in the film is from Trevor Morgan, in a small part as a young stud Ryan dates.  The film piles bad jokes one on top of the other and beats to death what wasn\\'t particularly funny the first time -- the Italian chef who pines for Marty, the FBI agents\\' jokes about how hot Marty supposedly is, etc. I guess it does this because it has nothing else to do. There\\'s just nothing going on here, no romance, almost no comedy, certainly no suspense, and we lost logic in the first five minutes. The only thing that can recommend this movie is seeing the crack-up of a once gifted actress. There\\'s a certain fascination in that, Ryan\\'s performance is a slow-moving train wreck. I hope she gets it together and comes back in better form next time.',\n",
       " b\"I am appalled at how bad this film is. As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a film worse than those 2. Granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period. Nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar.  First off there's the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, did you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies??? Holy smoke, these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting.  Well, Last Picture Show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better. Guess rubbing up against Welles & Hitch & Ford wore off a long time ago. Still good for hosting TCM though.\",\n",
       " b'Jerry Seinfeld is one of the funniest stand up comedians out there today. Sure he may not be a saint (buying a whole building just for his cars)- but we do need to cut him some slack as he provided millions of people with millions of laughs for a long time. I saw \"I\\'m Telling You For The Last Time\" before I actually got into the series itself (I was young when it first aired and so now I am feasting off reruns). The fact that I had not seen nearly every Seinfeld episode (which now I have see most of) made this bit of stand up even funnier as I had never heard most jokes before. But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny. Definitely recommended to all Seinfeld fans and I believe that many others will also be entertained. If you liked this and the Seinfeld series I would also recommend Jerry Seinfeld\\'s book \"SeinLanguage\". Of course it\\'s much funnier when you can can see and hear him tell the jokes and so if this ever comes on TV again you can bet I\\'ll be taping it.',\n",

       " b\"(Spoiler included, some would say)  This film is not possible to take seriously. At some parts it is so awfully stupid that I just can't help laughing at it all. Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite. Yeah, what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats? I dunno, but he sure gives reality a run for the money.\",\n",

Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him (he was mad that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker's right winged philosophies? The series went on, but it just didn't have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked out. Ah well, that's show business.\",\n",
       " b'I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino\\'s favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I\\'ve never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the \"furniture\" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that\\'s been done since - but there aren\\'t many films that are so consistently original like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some great sets too. Just when you thought you\\'d seen everything . . .',\n",
       " b'This is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the Rider Haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with Russian soldiers seeking a \"Stone of Power\" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon. It\\'s very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of Africa, and very well acted. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help rescue her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not named in IMDb\\'s listing) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood can\\'t leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it\\'s too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.',\n",
       " b\"Will Smith is at his best. He never played a role like this one before, and he certainly does it very well, in my opinion it would be worth his first Oscar this year.  It is a motion picture that makes you cry, laugh and admire this little guy who is just struggling ten times more than the others and still trying to handle everything...the story is full of feeling, and the father-son combo Smith is just as genuine as they could be.  The only weak point in my view (maybe as an European): while the story is very nice, it seems a bit too optimistic and focused on the typical American dream scheme: just believe in yourself and you'll be rewarded.  But in the end, a very nice movie you'll have to see!\",\n",

Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey have good chemistry together.Tom Berenger makes an awesome \"cowboy\" type of romantic lead. Native Americans are well represented. This movie helps open the eyes of what it was like for the Cheyenne Indians plight to escape the forbearance of the Whiteman. Like Lewis Gates says: \"I was born a hundred years to late,\" which is exactly the way I feel. The music portrays romanticism, and boldness, kind of like the westerns of days gone by. The dog \"Zip\" is an actor in himself. He is well trained. The scenery is awesome! Take me to Canmore, Canada, or is it the Oxbows? Which ever, I loved this movie! Would like to live this dream come true.',\n",

As others have noted, the CGI aerial sequences sometimes have the aircraft moving in unnatural or impossible ways, and this is visually jarring. (After the touch-and-go, Air Force One turns a 180 almost like a helicopter) I gave it a 7 out of 10 - not brilliant, but makes for an entertaining evening.',\n",

From the opening scene in the Mumbai airport with its marble floors and dirty white walls... to the teeming crowds waiting outside (I had one white face meeting me at 4:00 a.m. after flying from Orlando to Detroit to Amsterdam to Mumbai to Hyderabad, amidst the hundreds of brown faces clamoring for your attention)... to the little three-wheeled jeeps careening through the streets... the marvelous shots of Victoria Station and the Gateway of India... to the merriment of Holi. Not to mention the call center agents!  This film (and the howls of laughter from those in attendance, at the 13th Annual South Asian Film Festival, here in Orlando at http://www.enzian.org/ ) made me want to pack up and go back tomorrow.  \"I\\'d kNowingly Do It Again!\"',\n",

What we have here are some terrorist from Russia I think (why are terrorist from countries that don't actually have gripes with us in the movies) taking over air force one with president and family in tow. Of course, the president does not get captured, but instead eludes the terrorist and complicates matters for them as he frees some of the hostages and instead of leaving himself stays to get his family back. The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys. Speaking of bad guys, Gary Oldman is pretty good here as the head bad guy, so is most of the cast of this flick. Harrison Ford is usually good in anything so he fits right in here and makes for a very heroic albeit unrealistic president.\",\n",
       " b\"As there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville. I really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned. This was by far one of the worst. With in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on Clark's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week. May as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day.\",\n",

Personal freedoms from political to moral. Liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction. Their creative views of life and writing. Describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse. Along with the distractions and affections each share.

       " b'Another movie with Christopher \"There\\'s a clause in my contract that says I have to be in at least one scene of every movie\" Walken where he wastes his talent.   All-American Murder is a pretty pathetic movie, especially the ridiculous ending. I would compare it to \\'Blue City,\\' the Alley Sheedy/Judd Nelson \"thriller\" about some fast talking cocky kid who wants to avenge his father\\'s death. But, he never stops with his cocky, mouthing off, even in the face of a mafia and corrupt government officials. And his adversaries only react with stupid, empty threats. Where\\'s the action? Where\\'s the suspense?   Like it was in \\'Blue City\\', the main character (Schlatter) and many of those around him react too unbelievably, given the situation they\\'re in, making it one laughable, ridiculous movie.   The story centers on Schlatter, who plays a similar fast-talking, cocky kid, but a well-meaning one. A student a college, he tries to sweet talk one of the sorority girls into going out with him. But, unfortunately, he should\\'ve just settled for \\'no,\\' because when he shows up one night, she bombs out of the building and burns to death. And since he was the only one around, he must be the culprit. Well, surely a misunderstanding such as this calls for ample chase scenes, as Schlatter tries to prove his innocence, especially with a cold cop breathing down his neck and giving him a deadline, basically, before he hauls him into jail, his patience wearing thin.  But, neither the killer\\'s identity, nor the motives, nor the finale, are all that interesting, and the end is just plain stupid. At least if the rest of the movie were just simply mediocre (it is actually worse than that), than a strong ending might\\'ve saved it. But it didn\\'t. Not at all.  I can see why Schlatter was in this movie. This is basically his schtick--the happy-go-lucky charming guy who tries to get the girl (see 18 Again!), and he\\'s good at it, except this kind of story doesn\\'t call for that kind of character throughout the whole movie. Everybody seems to be too passive in situations that require emergency, making the whole thing seem pretty stupid. Schlatter\\'s good nature humor may\\'ve worked if there was anything really going on in the story. But there isn\\'t. And of course, just because Christopher Walken is in a movie, doesn\\'t make it a good movie. Here, he is a good actor in a bad movie.   If it\\'s thrillers you\\'re in the mood for, even cheap ones, I\\'d recommend looking elsewhere.',\n",
       " b'I\\'m still wondering why \"Axe (a.k.a. Lisa, Lisa)\" was one of the notorious video nasty\\'s in the 80\\'s. It really doesn\\'t have the quality or the shocking moments that made comparable movies like \"Last house on the Left\" and \"I Spit on your Grave\" so infamous and instant classics. The story is rather dull with almost no action and the characters are very stereotypical. The most strange thing is that there appear to be two different versions: the cut and the uncut one. I\\'m sure I saw the uncut version, but I\\'m wondering what in the hell had to be cut out for the \"R-rated\" version. There\\'s no gore, just some blood which was rather fake, red paint that was way to bright. The movie clocks off at 68 (!!) minutes, but that\\'s o.k: I guess you couldn\\'t stretch this simple story any longer. Worth a look only for the 70\\'s and early 80\\'s mood, that\\'s done well but no classic in my book.',\n",
       " b\"What could be so frightening and irrational that a scientist would choose to freeze to death rather than confront it? You'll find out.  While we think of scientists as being unflinching heroic seekers of truth, they can be pretty nutty people in denial of reality (it's true!). The movie is about two different types of scientists who are trying to complete some research involving monkeys in a remote freezing mountain environment. The experiment was left uncompleted by the death of a scientist who seems to have gone insane, and died freezing to death. Regardless of the fact that the audience can more-or-less figure out who the culprit is, the last 30 seconds are incredibly chilling to see. Imagine characters debating if a shark was involved in the deaths in JAWS, but only in the last minute of film you finally see a fin circling the hero. Or a ventriloquist who insists his dummy is alive, and at the end you see it move. Worth watching in the dark for the very creepy climax.   Kudos for the director's long-takes and Gil (Andromeda Strain) Melle's unsettling score.\",\n",
       " b'In 1909, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle are best friends and juvenile criminals. Tom\\'s brother Mike is a correct teenager. Along the years, Tom (James Cagney) and Matt (Edward Woods) get older and ranked in criminal scale of their gang leaded by Nails Nathan (Leslie Fenton). When Nails dies in an accident, his gang becomes weaker and is attacked by other criminal groups.  \"The Public Enemy\" is a great gangster movie, picturing the life and death of a typical gangster of the 30\\'s in a contemporary moment. The texts in the introduction and conclusion of the movie may seem dated today, but show the concern of the director and screenplay writers with the difficult moment that USA was living in 1931. Further, it belongs to the beginning of the sound age, and William Wellman uses this resource magnificently, like for example, when the truck is discharging coal to disguise the shooting. James Cagney is perfect in his trademark role, and this movie is still good in 2006. My vote is eight.  Title (Brazil): \"Inimigo P\\xc3\\xbablico No. 1\" (\"Public Enemy Number 1\")',\n",
       " b'Few films have stayed with me like \"The Bad News Bears\". I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent). It was easy to cheer for this gang of misfits back then. The surprising this is, I always find myself tuning in to catch it whenever it appears on TV. It remains a surprisingly accurate portrait of young ball players, snobby league officials and overbearing parents. Walter Matthau is Buttermaker, the coach assigned to lead this motley crew of talentless kids. Their fortunes change somewhat when Matthau convinces the daughter of an old girlfriend (Tatum O\\'Neal, just coming off a shocking Oscar win for \"Paper Moon\") to pitch for the team. Buttermaker taught her to throw a mean curveball prior to divorcing her mother. The Bears go from losers to winners when the local juvenile delinquent, Kelly Leak, joins the team. He\\'s a virtual one-man team, swatting home-runs and catching everything in sight. The Bears end up going all the way to the championship game against the hated Yankees. The cast is excellent. Matthau is completely believable as a washed-up ex pro ball player who drinks too much. O\\'Neal is convincing as the star hurler, and Jackie Earl Haley (\"Breaking Away\") makes a strong impression as Leak. Ironically, this is one of the few movies where Haley is one of the bigger kids. In later roles, he would always be the short guy in the group. Vic Morrow is perfectly smug as the Yankees coach who can\\'t stand to see the Bears succeed. It sets up a classic battle in the championship game. The Bad News Bears was the forerunner, of sorts, of The Mighty Ducks. The main difference is that The Bad News Bears gets the baseball details right, whereas few American films have portrayed hockey in a realistic way. I still cringe at the thought of \"Youngblood\". It also set the stage for two vastly inferior sequels (without Matthau or O\\'Neal). No, The Bad News Bears is a cut above most sports films because it helps you understand what it\\'s like to compete at that age. It also makes great use of music from Bizet\\'s Carmen. After seeing this film, you\\'ll immediately think of the Bears when you hear the \"March of the Torreodors\".',\n",
       " b'This is an utterly putrid film of Jim Thompson\\'s terrific novel, \"A Swell-Looking Babe.\" In adapting the book for the screen, writer Denis Johnson has stripped the novel of all its dark humor and subtext and given us a tepid and dull film.   Gone are the father and the whole McCarthyism subplot, which is crucial to what the protagonist does. And Thompson\\'s denouement was dripping with irony.   Thompson\\'s protagonist was a multi-layered character who had good reasons for what he did. Here, Elias Koteas is just a boring hotel employee. No offense to the actress who plays the femme fatale, but the role needs someone with a lot more substance than she brings to it.  William H. Macy might be highlighted on the DVD box, but he has just one scene. That\\'s it. Come to think of it, he might have been better in the lead role.  Do yourself a favor. Instead of renting this piece of crap, read the novel. Your time and money would be better spent.',\n",
       " b'I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was slightly worried at first that subtitles were a bit ambitious for hungover Sunday viewing but it was fairly easy to keep up.  The two plot lines seem completely separate at first and they are nicely tied together later in the film. This works very well at giving two sides of an event without resorting to flashbacks or spoon-feeding the viewer.  You do have to think and pay attention to this film but it is not overly cryptic - I think I understood everything I needed to at the end. Some minor details might be a little blurry but these are not integral to the plot.  Some racial stereotypes aside this is a very well thought out and captivating film.',\n",
       " b'Like other people who commented on \"Fr\\xc3\\xa4ulein Doktor\" I stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night TV without having heard of it before. The strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning.  To me this is one of the five best movies about WWI (the others are \"All Quiet On The Western Front\", \"Paths Of Glory\", \"Gallipoli\" and the post-war \"La vie et rien d\\'autre\"). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks.  I only wish I had taped the film.',\n",
       " b\"The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comical. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. The only saving grace I found with this film is it's production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. Other than the production value I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film.\",\n",
       " b'This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. It is by far much better than some other New York films of the same era such as: \"The French Connection\" or \"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3\". There is a gritty reality to this film which also manages to effectively use humor to further the plot line. It\\'s engaging from start to finish and hasn\\'t tarnished with age as is the case with the above two examples.  Ron Liebman turns in a bravura performance as \"Batman\" and it\\'s a shame his career didn\\'t take off as a result of this project.  Gordon Parks directs and, coming as it does after \"Shaft\", it at first appears to be a strange choice. Yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo.  Unfortunately this film has not been made available on either DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a gem on their hands and it\\'s a shame they\\'re not doing anything with it.',\n",
       " b\"I have never been in the United States, least of all in New York. But through some directors' works I have built up an image of the city that never sleeps that's made of jazz, petty crooks and gangsters, Godard-lovers, intellectual wanna-be socialite... For all I know, New York is what can be seen through the eyes of Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese... and Francis Ford Coppola.   I would pretty much compare ONE FROM THE HEART to Allen's MANHATTAN, in the sense that both are new-yorkers visions of romance and beauty, filtered through a broadway theatrical and glamorous sensibility. This film, however, unlike MANHATTAN, isn't about New York. It's about spining through the spotlights of a city that parties all night long (cabarets, jazz, dance and magical flirts), only to realize that in the end, it's going to be your simple significant other waiting for you in the backstage.  The staging of the whole movie helps a lot, in the sense that's it's all filmed in studio. Magical skies and dawns that make it easy to pass from a store-window directly to a sunset in Bora-Bora; lust and life and music in what I would consider the last great musical. Every once in a while, Coppola gives us a glimpse of his more passionate side. This would then be the sunny side of the melancholic DRACULA.  Add to the magical staging the nightly cabaret-like musical score by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle and one can't help but be amazed with it all. And I thought I was surprised by Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  If this is the way new-yorkers see life, that's the city I want to live in.\",\n",
       " b'When watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying. First of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every clich\\xc3\\xa9 possible, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there. On the top of it all comes the \"message\" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most ostensible manner. The actors, as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: the \"I am a good carrying person\" smile, the concerned look and the \"victory is ours\" body posture, while the bad guys have the \"I\\'m a bad one\" frowning and the \"you caught me\" look, followed by the \"I\\'m good for nothing and I should be removed from society\" head banding (this kind of also sums up the general development of each show). True story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that producers don\\'t give a s**t about viewers, that we are all thought to be idiots. Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you.',\n",
       " b'Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 withe George Cukor\\'s film version of \"Born Yesterday,\" and from that point forward, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again.  It never happened. In \"It Should Happen to You\" (I can\\'t think of a blander title, by the way), Holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who\\'s maybe not so dumb after all, but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe was his first film role, can\\'t muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up.  Maybe if you\\'re enamored of Holliday you\\'ll enjoy this; otherwise I wouldn\\'t bother.  Grade: C',\n",
       " b\"I have read the book and seen the movie and wasn't disappointed by either. I am a Strieber fan so appreciated what risks he took to write this autobiographical novel. It's true the book does have a different feel to the movie. This is mostly due, I believe to, the director Philippe Mora and Christopher Walken's quirky yet memorable acting presence.  This film is very eerie, frightening, surreal and disturbing. It's not a feel-good movie but is definitely thought-provoking, just like the novel.  This is definitely one of Walken's best movies. I was impressed! Also Joel Carlson does a great job as Strieber's son, Andrew. The scenes involving his son and the other dream sequences are perhaps the most disturbing.  I felt empathy for Strieber in Walken's very convincing performance. I felt drawn to the character and his family.  I find myself watching this film every few years and as I do it is more rewarding each time. There are some very memorable lines in this movie that will stay with you long afterwards.  If you like thought-provoking, eerie, movies involving alien abduction then this may be well worth your while.\",\n",

BUT and it is a big BUT i decided for something this special i had to pull my head out of the sand, tonight i watched the season finale and i have to say i had my eye on the clock out of fear of when it would end.  This show has brought me nothing but happiness from the first episode to the last. Every character is written and cast to perfection, every shot is done brilliantly, ever episode is funny, clever and most of all enjoyable and will keep you baited until the next week.  In essence this is probably the greatest import from America i have seen in recent years. Now don't get me wrong, i love Friends/the Simpson's/family guy/Scrubs/South park/dirty sexy money/pushing daisies/west wing etcetc  but nothing quite compares to the originality or catch of this, certainly it is probably the best show i have seen in years in terms of enjoyment  the only negative thing i can dare say about it is the fact the first series is over  long live reaper!  for those that haven't seen it, it is truly a gem to behold, for those that have and arnt obsessed with it, shame on you!  i love this program so much. If you have a complaint with what i've said, go ahead and complain to me, i really don't care anymore, this show is too good to miss out on or miss the chance to explain how unbelievably good it is, so all you nay-sayers do your worst, this show is near perfection and i am more than happy to admit it.

The way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets a great example of the way we should live our lives.

Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers with Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of EVERYONE in the family it's better. DJ, the oldest daughter, is growing up whether her dad wants it to happen or not. One thing they all share is they miss their mom.

       " b'The title of the film is a perfect depiction of what the story is about: \"The Unsaid\" is a journey full of agony and tension, into the deep-buried and untold secrets lurking in the hearts of Tommy Caffey (Kartheiser) and his therapist, Dr. Michael Hunter (Garcia).  Dr. Hunter, who has not completely recovered from the shock of his son\\'s Kyle (Blumas) suicide, is persuaded by a former student of his, Dr. Wagner (Polo), to take the case of a seemingly normal adolescent, Tommy. The young boy, who in the past suffered a deeply traumatic experience by watching his father kill his mother, initially gets along well with his new therapist; moreover, Dr. Hunter himself seems to draw comfort from the boy\\'s presence, as he reminds him of his lost son. However, things gradually become more complicated, as Tommy and Shelly (Cordellini), the daughter of Dr. Hunter, meet and become fond of each other; moreover, Tommy\\'s case is not as simple as it first seemed...  The film portrays three troubled characters: Kyle, Tommy, and Hunter himself. The performances by the respective actors, namely Blumas, Kartheiser, and Garcia, are simply superb. Although one might expect such A-level acting by a star of Andy Garcia\\'s caliber, it is positively surprising and very heartening to watch young actors doing such a good job. Cordellini is also very convincing as Hunter\\'s detached and confused daughter, while the rest of the cast remains on a generally satisfactory level.  McLoughlin\\'s direction is balanced and well-executed, building up the tension when he should, but without resorting to needless exaggerations.  \"The Unsaid\" is overall a solid film that studies the secrets buried inside the human soul. 7/10.',\n",

By usual I mean the fight fought for so long between black and white, South and North...Latinos and Americans. Sergio Arau and his wife Areli envision a LA with no Mexicans, just like the title say. Their sense of humor is fantastic to say the least. I never laughed so hard. They not only succeeded in portraying a truly \"lonely\" city, chaotic and all but they could also capture the true essence of Latinos which lies in these three words: Tenderness, care and RESPECT. This is not your \"typical\" movie. You will also love the closing scene and the nice final twist. I think both Latino and Americans alike will enjoy this. Thank you Cristina',\n",

Jamie Lee Curtis delivers an awful performance but not all the blame can be placed on her. The writing is far to witty at times to be spoken by people going about their day and the plots events that occur are totally unbelievable. There is one scene in which Heidi watches a film and then a few days later the romantic scene that occurred in the film happens to her in \"real life.\" Often times I found myself laughing when the mood of the film was meant to be serious. It just isn\\'t good, flat out. Also I thought the film played too much on gay and lesbian stereotypes.',\n",
       " b'The Great Santini (Jack Cassidy) is a brilliant stage magician with a hidden past. His real name is Stefan Mueller and he was an SS officer assigned to the concentration camps. Jesse Jerome (Nehemiah Persoff), his current employer, has learned of the illusionist\\'s Nazi career and is using the information to blackmail him. One night, while ostensibly performing his celebrated trick of being locked in a steel cabinet and dowsed in a tank of water, Santini is really disguising himself as a waiter and walking unseen to Jerome\\'s office. When Jerome turns up dead, it looks like a contract killing. But our rumpled, redoubtable Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), assisted by the overeager Sgt. Wilson (Bob Dishy), has a few tricks of his own.  If Columbo can outmaneuver a chess champion (\"The Most Dangerous Match\"), out-think a scientific genius (\"Mind Over Mayhem\") and outwit a master spy (\"Identity Crisis\"), what made a master illusionist think he could do any better?  This is a splendid \"Columbo\" episode, with all the tricky plotting, delightful comedy and tense cat-and-mouse play that fans love. Did I mention the comedy? In the weak \"Greenhouse Jungle,\" Bob Dishy is clearly a good actor playing a tedious character. Here he returns as Sgt. Wilson but the script by Michael Sloan is much better. Wilson\\'s comic business, this time involving Columbo\\'s new raincoat, is much better integrated into the plot than in \"Greenhouse\"\\xc2\\x97and it\\'s much funnier.  Harvey Hart does a very nice directing job. Somebody in his crew had an excellent eye for detail. I especially like how a little water trickles out of the trap door after Santini\\'s daughter (Cynthia Sikes) opens it.  The ending is ordinary, without one of those great thunderclap surprises, as in \"A Stitch in Crime\" and \"Suitable for Framing.\" I love the final scene anyway, with Columbo\\'s funny yet unnerving imitation of a magician\\'s stage technique. This \"Columbo\" will work like magic on any fan.',\n",
       " b'It\\'s impossible for a Beatles fan such as myself to be objective about \\'Let It Be,\\' so this is more remembrance than review. For example, I remember being 14 years old, picking up the newspaper one day and seeing a small headline that read, \"Beatles back together!\" or something similar. This, I thought, was good news even though I wasn\\'t really aware that they had permanently split. The headline as it turns out was misleading, to say the least. It simply meant that \\'Let It Be,\\' the movie, was finally opening in our town. I didn\\'t see it then; it was several years later, when it was a staple at \\'midnight movie\\' showings (as was \\'Magical Mystery Tour\\'). The average non-Beatles-loving film critic typically describes \\'Let It Be\\' as slow-moving, boring in places, with only one really good scene- the rooftop concert at the end. For someone though who\\'s early life played to an ongoing soundtrack of Beatle songs, \\'Let It Be\\' is a wistful, sad, occasionally funny, open yet closed look at our heroes as they make preparations for their own funeral. The Beatles actually would continue for another year after the film was shot (they had yet to make \\'Abbey Road,\\' for instance), but it is clear that \\'Let It Be\\' catches them at as low a point as they were to reach in many ways. John sings but talks very little; he was into \\'non-verbal communication\\' at the time, which basically meant staring blankly at other people and not answering them. When you consider there were hundreds of hours shot and Lennon was famous for his wit, it is a bit depressing that what we see in these ninety minutes was considered the best footage available of him. George Harrison is somewhat more talkative and not very happy either; he tries to appear reasonable but it\\'s clear that Paul McCartney is like a festering wound to him that won\\'t heal or go away. At times this animosity boils over (though only occasionally in the released version; there are many more examples in the unreleased footage) such as the infamous exchange between Paul and George during a dispute over how George should play a guitar part. \"I\\'ll play whatever you want me to play, or I won\\'t play at all if you don\\'t want me to play,\" Harrison snaps. \"Whatever it is that will please you, I\\'ll do it.\" Ringo provides a comforting presence, his hang-dog, neither here nor there expression almost uplifting given the circumstances. The only one of the four who seems able to muster enthusiasm for the project, or anything else for that matter, is Paul McCartney. He is seen throughout as cajoling, joking, arguing, pestering, and in general urging the others on, suggesting ideas for the film and beyond. Depending on one\\'s point of view and opinion of McCartney, he is either the one Beatle still trying to create magic, or a colossal pain in the ass. It seems clear the other Beatles consider him the latter, at least at this point in time. There are lots of off-key rehearsals in the film, but also a few finished set-pieces, mainly of McCartney songs like \\'Two Of Us\\' and the title track, which is a wonderfully subdued performance by the four. Still, by this point in the movie, one begins to feel that the only way \\'Let It Be\\' can redeem itself is by all four Beatles setting up their amps and drum kit somewhere and playing some good old rock and roll. Which is exactly what they do, on the rooftop of the Apple building. For the last twenty minutes or so, all the bad vibes magically, mysteriously vanish and the Beatles are the Beatles again, charging through \\'Get Back,\\' \\'I\\'ve Got A Feeling,\\' \\'Don\\'t Let Me Down,\\' and \\'One After 909\\', before reprising \\'Get Back\\' as London police show up to wag their fingers and tell the Fab Four to turn that noise down. It\\'s a great, funny, energetic scene that has since passed into legend, and rightfully so. And it sees \\'Let It Be\\' ending on just the right note, as our heroes exit the stage for the last time.',\n",

I must say that none of the actors were difficult to watch, and the director made me see his whole intention. I will probably rent it again to show some folks whom I believe could appreciate the quality that has been displayed in Blue Hill Avenue.

This movie is hysterical...all the way down to the score. Jack Lemmon\\'s tension and neurotic persona are brilliantly played out. Sandy Dennis was the perfect compliment to his \"fast-paced\" character. Her ability to stand by her man and be the obliging wife echoes both the time period of this movie, as well as her direct dichotomy to her husband\\'s personality. They are simply perfect together. I know others have commented on her annoying voice, but to me, that made her part hilarious. There are so many funny scenes, and I find myself smiling throughout the entire movie. From the \"circling and stacking\", the buckling ankles, the Cuban ambassador fiasco, all the way to the end of the movie hijackers, this film is a true gem.',\n",
       " b'\"Reign of Fire\" is a cheeseball special effects fest that is a great time killer if you have time to kill. I recommend it only if you want to kill some time and brain cells in the process. Here are the reasons (spoilers herein): (1) The computer generated dragons are pretty neat. (2) Christian Bale did pretty good as the main scarred survivor. (3) The scene with the dragon attacking the castle was very poetic. (4) There was a tinge of a medieval mentality going through this film. (5) The mixture of recent, old-fashioned, and ancient weaponry fit together perfectly to give an idea of how combat flying, fire-breathing reptiles. (6) The Brits and The Americans fighting amongst themselves showed that cultural differences will breed a bunch of dissent and angst in situations where survival is at stake. (7) Amongst the Brits, differing views of survival were seen. Seven reasons gives a score of seven.  The downers in the film were (1) Matthew McConaughey as the tooth and nail American commander. He doesn\\'t strike me as the tooth and nail type (watch \"The Wedding Planner\" and you\\'ll understand). (2) The Americans are portrayed as if they are a bunch of marauders. Stereotyping anything sucks and it should be stopped. (3) The story had gaping plot holes and lots of tedious dialogue. The writing overall was lacking in many spots. Overall, this is a film that feels like cheesecloth. Watch it if you want to kill some brain cells but I suggest many other titles. Here ends my rant!',\n",
       " b\"During the 1970's the three major networks (mostly ABC) made a slew of Made for TV movies. Many of them were junk, some were imitations of Hollywood hits at the time, and more than a few were excellent films. This is one of them.   I'm fortunate to own this movie and watched it just last night. I won't recant the plot, for you can find that here. but I will say this - this movie holds up very well as the years have gone by. The look and feel of it really captures the isolation and situation. The script isn't filled with old 70's clich\\xc3\\xa9d dialog, and is very well paced. It's very well shot, and very well acted by two solid actors. Gil Melle's synthesizer score, while dated, fits the film quite well. Some of the effects are old, but there aren't very many, and don't detract from the story. If you are fortunate to get a look at this old movie you won't be disappointed.   Although I see the point of another reviewer who stated this movie's obscurity is part of it's charm, ABC (and the other networks) need to dig into their archives and re-master and release some of the good old TV movies to DVD. This one, A Short Walk to Daylight, Dying Room Only, many others.\",\n",
       " b'It\\'s a crying shame that this show doesn\\'t occupy its rightful place in the pantheon of late night talk shows. Sometimes, large swaths of the show would go by without a single laugh, but you would still turn off the TV feeling you\\'d watched something entertaining. It\\'s hard to explain; it was humor as dry as it comes. And when the show was hitting on all cylinders it was an absolute riot. The standout episode to me was the one in which Lily Tomlin came on to promote her movie \"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe\". Instead of answering the questions as herself, she portrayed a Manhattan socialite who had been a financial backer of the film. To top it off, the character she played despised Lily Tomlin. Yet the interview seemed so real, with Havey appearing to actually get upset at the woman\\'s snootiness. I\\'ve not seen a situation like this on any other show (except Tuesday Night Titans). I hope some network rolls out re-runs someday.',\n",
       " b\"Just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home. She then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.  This is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite. I can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that I kind of wished it was better, or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size. I think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong.\",\n",
       " b\"Before I completely tear apart this abortion, let me come out and say that this game should not be praised at all. Whoever applauds Square for this game isn't experienced in (a) the world of writing or (b)the field of video games. Now, I've been playing RPGs for quite some time, and I know a tasteless game when I see one.  Graphics: Much like that of FFVII's style, Final Fantasy VII's graphics are 3-dimensional. However, there are still so many flawed aspects. For example, the characters are deprived of facial expressions. (2/10) Sound: The musical collection of Final Fantasy VIII veers away from the norm. Although the theme of this installment was a nice touch, the rest of the soundtrack was bitterly mediocre in comparison to that of its predecessors. (4/10) Plot: Do I really need to explain how dull this game is? I suppose so, then. -sigh- Well, after the first disk, you're left with a cheap plot. In reference to the events, I'll put them in order from 1 to 5.  1 - The supposed genius--Squall--becomes a SeeD along with his moronic friends.  2 - Squall meets his apparent girlfriend, Rinoa, and drifts away from the interverte-lifestyle little by little.  3 - After totally pwning the insipid blob (Edea) and her lackey (Seifer) Squall realizes that his job applies to murdering the sorceresses of this wretched fantasy.  4 - After beating Edea's butt again, Ultimecia controls Rinoa's fail!Mary-Suish body.  5 - Squall and friends gain control of their Sue and beat Ultimecia's butt. Yeah, I said butt again. =OOOO That's about it. The developers decided on tying in some other events . . . but that idea kinda died. R.I.P. Good idea? (1/10) Playability: Remember the Junction system? Do you ever recall the amount of time that you spent spamming your character's stats with efficient spells, such as Ultima or Aero. But to punish these actions, you must first equip your faithful GF to any of the characters. How long does this process take again? Fifteen to twenty minutes at least.  In fact, the Junction system is so time-consuming that you resort to actually turning off this game after this process is completed. The gameplay isn't stimulating, as well.  Value: Relatively low.  Overall Rating: 1/10 I hope that this review will fix the crappy rating that this game scored. :D\",\n",
       " b'One of the really bad films of the year. It would be tempting to blame it on writer/director Brad Silberling, but no one in this film acquits him or herself admirably. Susan Sarandon struggles to bring her usual fiery passion to a  dully-written part, Dustin Hoffman looks great but is otherwise a bore, and  Jake Gyllenhaal comes across as an annoying Tobey Maguire clone, but  even more annoying than Tobey.  The nadir? Possibly this line from Sarandon: \"You\\'ve given us all a big  truth enema.\" Yeah, there\\'s eloquence for you! Gyllenhaal whines his way  through an unbelievably bad courtroom scene that provokes a desire to  smack him one, and Holly Hunter looks embarrassed as a district attorney.   A low mark for all concerned.',\n",
       " b\"I have to say when a name like Zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover I was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku, but what I got instead was a comedy. So, it wasn't quite was I was expecting, but I really liked it anyway! The best scene ever was the main cop dude pulling those kids over and pulling a Bad Lieutenant on them!! I was laughing my ass off. I mean, the cops were just so bad! And when I say bad, I mean The Shield Vic Macky bad. But unlike that show I was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope.  Felissa Rose...man, oh man. What can you say about that hottie. She was great and put those other actresses to shame. She should work more often!!!!! I also really liked the fight scene outside of the building. That was done really well. Lots of fighting and people getting their heads banged up. FUN! Last, but not least Joe Estevez and William Smith were great as the...well, I wasn't sure what they were, but they seemed to be having fun and throwing out lines. I mean, some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick, but who cares when you're laughing so hard! All in all the film wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread, but I wasn't expecting that. It was a Troma flick so I figured it would totally suck. It's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking.  Rent it if you want to get stoned on a Friday night and laugh with your buddies. Don't rent it if you are an uptight weenie or want a zombie movie with lots of flesh eating.  P.S. Uwe Boil was a nice touch.\",\n",
       " b'\"AVALANCHE\" is definitely one of the weaker entries into the \\'disaster\\' genre that populated the 70\\'s and early 80\\'s. A cast of fading actors and the \"who\\'s that?\" of Hollywood headline this atrocious production that delivers more laughs than anything.  Following the formula of its preceding disaster foes, \"AVALANCHE\" combines interwoven plot-lines involving love affairs and the disaster itself. Thrown into this sorry melange are Rock Hudson, Robert Forster, Mia Farrow and 50\\'s silver screen star, Jeanette Nolan.  In \"AVALANCHE\", Rock Hudson is David Shelby - a well-meaning but extremely foolish ski-resort owner who has ignored all warnings from environmentalists in building a new ski-resort while removing all the trees in the process which spells the perfect recipe for disaster. Robert Forster is the environmentalist who warns Hudson that removing all the trees from the mountain will result in causing deadly avalanches. Mia Farrow is Hudson\\'s ex-wife, new love interest to Forster and Jeanette Nolan is Hudson\\'s flighty mother who likes nothing more than a Bloody Mary to sip on every five minutes.  Also thrown into this sordid tale are further cardboard cut-out characters including a champion skiier who is hell-bent on bedding as many women as he can before the screen credits go up and his jilted lover (wonderfully portrayed by Cathy Paine) who hams it up in a campy performance that involves her threatening to slice his cheating \\'ass\\' with a butter knife before having a cup of milk thrown onto her as she falls to the floor screaming hysterically.  Rock Hudson in his early 50\\'s (his first foray into the \\'disaster\\' genre) appears like a disheveled modern-day version of William Shatner. Spending precious minutes on-screen wearing nothing but turtle-necks and begging Mia Farrow to \\'come back\\' to him, he looks quite ridiculous in a role that was intended for someone in their 30\\'s as Mia Farrow is only about 33 years old at the time this movie was made. Much like \"EARTHQUAKE\" where Charlton Heston was courting a young Genevieve Bujold and \"THE CASSANDRA CROSSING\" where Ava Gardner was shagging a youthful Martin Sheen, the love affair in this movie is quite unbelievable.  Robert Forster, fresh off his canceled television stint in the short-lived 1974 \"NAKIA\", proves a credible character as an environmentalist who foresees the inevitable disaster, yet cannot convince a soul to believe or listen to him. As a result, the second plot line enters and we see him and Mia Farrow sharing a love scene together.   Jeanette Nolan in all of her faded beauty, spends most of her screen time either getting drunk on a Bloody Mary or hamming it up as the \\'ever-loving mother\\' who travels everywhere with her gay companion.  The setting is Hudson\\'s ski resort. Everyone is there for the grand opening which also includes some ridiculous mini Winter-Olympics festivities which has several hundred people either cross-country skiing, down-hill skiing, ski-dooing or watching the skating events and of course, what better day would there be to have a disaster than on this particular day?  The biggest laughs here of course is the disaster itself. In reality, there is nothing the slightest bit amusing about an avalanche, but while watching this movie, you can\\'t for a second take it seriously. A huge snow wedge hangs over the resort, loosely hanging on a snow-capped mountain that is broken off once a small charter plane crashes into it. Once the avalanche starts, the laughter begins. Stock footage of avalanches are spliced onto the film (you can tell by the grainy imagery and the totally different mountain ranges). The snow itself is nothing more than a smoke-machine adjusted to \\'fast forward\\' and huge blocks of styrofoam that are hurled through the air and bounce off the victims as they try to run away.  One particular hilarious scene involves a skater who is still spinning pirouettes on the ice as the avalanche engulfs her and the crowd (like she couldn\\'t hear or see the avalanche coming until it was about one foot away from her?). Another hilarious scene would involve a \\'gas\\' explosion inside the resort that is nothing more than a \\'puff of smoke\\' that sends one chef flying backwards into some shelves and an unlucky female that goes sliding along a counter while knocking off bowls of food onto the floor. But the one scene that really killed me was seeing the \\'animated sparks\\' that flash from the broken gear box that controls the ski-lift. We actually get to see this twice during a climatic scene involving a man and a child dangling from a broken ski-life. Here, rescue workers scramble to rescue the child using a safety net below, yet the man that is left dangling spends about three minutes complaining that he cannot \\'let go\\' and when he finally does (as a result of getting electrocuted), his lifeless body misses the safety net anyway!  Furthermore, back in town as the ambulances and rescue workers are dispatched from their outposts, it just goes to show that if the avalanche didn\\'t kill you, then these silly fools just might. In a totally ridiculous scene, ambulances and fire trucks spin out of control as they skid across the icy roads, causing serious fender-benders and sending one poor by-stander into a store-front window in a shower of shattering glass.  Unfortunately, the person who I felt sorry for the most was Jeanette Nolan. Once she gets trapped inside the hotel resort with her \\'companion\\', it takes her no longer than five minutes to go into hysterics and play the \"We\\'re all going to die!\" card as she digs at the snow with a chair. Then she starts to lose her mind as she plays the \"We go back a long way...\" card with her companion as she strikes the keys of a busted up grand piano, warbling a few notes of a song long forgotten. On top of that, she passes out just as Hudson and Forster make their way into the resort from the outside. After she has been resuscitated and placed into the back of an ambulance, she and Mia Farrow are driven to the hospital by some suicidal maniac who insists on doing wheelies on black ice and devastated terrain that results in the ambulance crashing through a bridge and into a chasm, Farrow managing to fall out of the car in time but leaving Nolan and the driver to meet a fiery death as the car explodes at the bottom of the chasm.  The climatic and grand finale scene of the film involves Mia Farrow hanging off the broken bridge railing and Hudson and Forster coming to her rescue. And when the day finally rolls to its end, Hudson and Farrow toast to the past events with a bottle of Champagne!!! Timeless!  If you want to see a scene involving Jeanette Nolan doing her best \\'Saturday Night Fever\\' impression on the dance floor, then this is the movie for you. If you want to see a pandemonium scene involving screaming victims getting hailed with styrofoam blocks, then this is the movie for you. However, if you want to see a half-decent disaster movie, then \"AVALANCHE\" is not the movie for you. The only thing that really separates \"AVALANCHE\" from the rest of the disaster entries are the few nude scenes that are thrown in involving a woman baring her breasts and buttocks in a \\'steamy\\' pool scene that really does nothing much for the movie itself.  This has got to be one of the stupidest movies that I have ever seen!  My rating - 2 out of 10',\n",

Sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely .

Together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon.  That\\'s the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. It just isn\\'t there. The acting is very weak too, which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead.  If you\\'re looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields. Her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb, that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything more could be made of this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must have even talked his father(Henry Fonda)into a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. Couldn\\'t Henry be in EASY RIDER for example? 3/10',\n",
       " b'The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as \"Kid\" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to \"The Grifters\", which was a good movie, this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all film noir fans.',\n",
       " b\"How can a movie be this noisy and still put me to sleep? Is it the writing, which would have me believe:  o An adventurer with seeming inexhaustible amounts of money would risk life and limb to GIVE away tons of arms and ammunition to `the revolution'? o That rebels would ride off and leave machine guns and light artillery pieces behind? o That Robert Mitchum, a prisoner scheduled to be shot, could hide two hand grenades in his jacket? o That Ursula Theiss, held hostage by seasoned rebels, would be allowed to keep a gun in her purse?   Ursula Theiss (Mrs. Robert Taylor) is pretty, but her love scenes with Mitchum lack spark. Far better is the interplay between Mitchum and Gilbert Roland, as well as his scenes with Zachery Scott and Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Torvay (Gonzalez). In fact Mitchum's scenes with practically everyone but Theiss are better than his with her. Not very smart when the plot devices hinge on the Mitchum / Theiss relationship.  Dull, dull, dull, and LOUD!\",\n",

Sure a lot of the scene's are pretty much exactly like scene's in the first one but there was plenty of good action and new scene's to make this movie strong. the ending gunfight in the strip club was pretty cool(Ive never seen so much glass break in my life), and the bus rolling over scene was cool too. Also, the dialogue scene's with Nolte and Murphy are just as funny as the ones in the first. I dont know why so many people think this is such a bad movie. Sure its not as fresh and original as the first one, but its still entertaining. 3.5/5\",\n",
       " b\"Before she was Mildred Pierce, Joan Crawford played the role of Sadie Thompson based on Somerset Maugham's story entitled Rain. She is a prostitute or too loose with the men especially the sailors. When she and others are stranded on Pago Pago in the Samoa, they have to stay there before they can go anywhere else. Walter Huston plays a devout religious hypocritical merciless minister who tries to steer Sadie in the right direction. Anybody else could have made Sadie either laughable or one-dimensional, Crawford shows her talent in keeping us to like and dislike her character. Crawford's first and final appearance is simply impressive. You can't take your eyes off her. She wants to be the star of the film and she is because she has the talent in order to succeed and she does to legendary status. Crawford's knack for being comical, cruel, vulnerable all at once in this role. Beulah Bondi has a supporting role. For one of the first films in the early thirties, it's an entertaining film.\",\n",
       " b\"Carlo Levi, an Italian who fought against the arrival of Fascism in his native Torino, was arrested for his activities and sent to exile in the Lucania region of the country, now known as Basilicata. The hill town of Gagliano was to be his home for the time he had to serve. This was the Italy of the 1930s where the rise of Mussolini and his quest for conquering Ethiopia, an ill conceived idea from the start.  We watch as Dr. Levi arrives at the Eboli station, where he must change to a local train and a taxi in order to reach the hill town, which was also the home of other political prisoners. Right after Levi descends from his train at Eboli, he sees Barone, a dog that has been abandoned and who will become his companion in exile. His arrival in Gagliano causes curiosity among the local folk, who see in him a cultured man who sticks out. Carlo Levi observes the people as he takes his daily walks. He can't help but notice how backward everyone seems to him. At the same time, he gets to appreciate them because even if they are ignorant of the outside world, they are genuine.  Levi, who had training as a physician, receives a visit from his sister Luisa, a doctor herself. He comments on the primitive state of medicine in the town, a place that boasts two doctors, who are ineffective and set in their ways. Levi clashes with the mayor, a man who is a devout follower of Mussolini and his movement, because the way he wants to censor his communication with friends. After he receives his release, Levi is not prepared for the way he made his presence felt among the locals who come to see him off.  Francesco Rosi, who adapted Carlo Levi's novel, is a director with a strong sense of political awareness. He presents the figure of Carlo Levi as a noble man who was helpless against what he wanted to do for the people of Gagliano, but the local government was not exactly enthusiastic about his meddling in the local affairs. Where he is able to connect with the populace is with his knowledge of medicine. Carlo Levi also painted the people of the region.  Gian Maria Volonte was an actor of quiet intensity. He is in almost all the scenes and he expresses a rage with his eyes. Mr. Volonte was the main reason for watching the film. Since he had collaborated with Rosi before, it seemed logical he would portray Carlo Levi in the movies, something that he does with ease and elegance. Others in the film include Lea Massari, as Luisa, Irene Papas as Giuglia, Alain Cluny as the Barone Nicola Rotondo. A favorable impression is made by Paolo Bonacelli, who appears as the mayor Luigi Magalone, who even when censoring Levi showed a lot of respect for him.  The actual filming was done in Aliano, an ancient hill town, where the real Carlo Levi went to live after the war. Pasqualino DeSantis, the cinematographer, captured in vivid images the picturesque town, the countryside and the people of this lost city. Francesco Rosi made an interesting film about a man of principle that will live forever.\",\n",

But the first half-hour is near hilarious with the usual Skelton mugging and pratfalls, backed up by experts Rags Ragland and Ann Rutherford, along with clever quips galore, so stay tuned. As usual, the plot amounts to little more than a convenient hat-rack on which to hang Skelton's usual brand of madcap. And what better fare for wartime audiences than a chance to escape the horrors with this slapstick whirlwind. I really did wonder how they would escape the elevator shaft, one of those great moments when you don't know whether to laugh or hide your eyes. And, yes, that is Jean Rogers as the reporter, on a break from Ming the Merciless and his serial effort at conquering the universe and Flash Gordon all in the same breath. There's also a chance to scope out Ebbetts Field and the Brooklyn Dodgers before both were torn down and shipped to LA. All in all, good period fun, even this many years later.\",\n",
       " b\"RUN...do not walk away from this movie!!!!! Aimed at the very young kids, this movie will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar, this film just lowered it. It's slow paced and the monster fighting is good, but seldom seen. This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box. Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series.  SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90's series will HATE this film.  10. This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die.  9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed.  8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. Big-eyed and cute...it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute.  7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along. I've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster.  6. Like Godzilla:Final Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. Final Wars had much more, actually, and better fights although short.  5. Kids take the title role. The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the 2000's. The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (thank god).  4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat.  3. This movie may produce a new Olympic event.....Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm's way. You have to see the ending to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yea..right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone.  2. The special effects were good, but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly. Not too impressive.  1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It comes off like a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all 3 references.  Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.\",\n",
       " b'Nowhere near as good as \"Mighty Peking Man\" as far as King Kong rip-offs, \"Ape\" is good to look at just to see the fair miniatures and little else. The best \"bad\" hilarious movies are those that never intended to be that; in \"Ape\", the Ape gets mad gives the finger in one scene, obviously in a deliberate attempt for laughs, which in turn, makes it pretty unfunny.  The sound effects are BAD, there\\'s a decent \\'bad\\' fight with a giant shark which couldn\\'t look much more fake if they tried, plus the Ape trashes a few buildings. If you are a giant monster film fan, this probably won\\'t get more than a few viewings in your entire lifetime but it\\'s good to watch and take off your list of films to see, plus to examine how badly this one was made.

       " b'Back in 1985 I caught this thing (I can\\'t even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control. I figured out early on that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while--but even he was bored after 30 minutes in. Remember--this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such. We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap! (One poster had a fictional review that said, \"This is the best movie I\\'ve seen this afternoon!\"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business. No-budget and boring t&a. Skip it.',\n",
       " b'The introduction of \"The Wig\" sets the tone which is dark and mysterious! Apart from a few creepy scenes this movie never gets scary! The idea of this evil wig has quite a potential in fantastic sense (It is interesting to see how the wig was created and why the wig does what it does) and on a psychological level (The effects of wearing a wig can be quite substantial especially on people who have lost their hair because of an illness! It could have some impact on their personality)! But sadly nothing is done with the far more interesting psychological aspects! At least not in the way I hoped for! Except for the brilliant plot twist this movie misses the mark completely! The fact that \"The Wig\" takes itself too seriously doesn\\'t help much! When the ambiance is this serious you expect to be scared! The problem is that this never happens! It is very difficult to get scared when the wig moves around like it is some sort of pet! It looks so ridiculous that it is painful to watch! It is difficult to say why this movie doesn\\'t work! But it doesn\\'t help that the actors are average,that there are too many plot holes and that the director didn\\'t know what he was doing!',\n",
       " b'The organizing department behind the After Dark Horrorfest clearly didn\\'t base their movie choices on plot originality; otherwise \"Lake Dead\" never would have made the final selection. This is a remotely entertaining little effort, but quite possibly also the most clich\\xc3\\xa9d horror movie I ever watched and it\\'s derivative of at least a dozen genre classics, including \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (original and remake), \"Friday the 13th\" ,\"Psycho\" and \"The Hills have Eyes (original and remake as well). Every prototypic twist you expect to happen in a backwoods horror slasher really does happen here, and at the exact moment you predicted it too, and every stereotypical character you anticipate to make an appearance also really does make an appearance at one point or another. Personally I have a high level of tolerance for the use of dreadful clich\\xc3\\xa9s, but if you\\'re exclusively looking for horror movies with innovating and daringly creative formulas feel free to skip this one, because it features absolutely nothing you haven\\'t seen a hundred times before. The plot primarily revolves on two attractive blond sisters, Brielle and Kelly Lake. Their last name is either a lack of scripting inspiration or a truly lame pun, because they actually inherit a lake and complementary lakeside motel somewhere in the middle of hillbilly nowhere. The girls gather a group of horny friends and decide to go camping in the area they inherited. Needless to say the testament was only a trick to lure the girls back to their family\\'s roots, where they\\'re required to continue an uncannily bizarre family tradition. There\\'s a revival of backwoods/inbred redneck horror movies going on lately, but somehow these newer films can\\'t accomplish the raw and nihilistic atmosphere of their 70\\'s colleagues. \"Lake Dead\" tries hard, but the film never evokes the slightest frights and not even the explicit gore has a shocking impact. The bloody make-up effects are nifty, but there\\'s too little variation in the characters\\' deaths and the film definitely also needed a couple of authentically perverted gimmicks. Incestuous sub plots and maniacal old ladies don\\'t upset anyone anymore nowadays, so \"Lake Dead\" is actually rather soft by today\\'s standards. The film stars an impressive number of sexy chicks (Kelsey Crane, Tara Gerard, Malea Richardson\\xc2\\x85), but I sincerely doubt long and fruitful careers are awaiting any of them. Oh, and now that our list of little complaints is quite long already, I don\\'t think the titular lake actually qualifies as a lake. It\\'s more like an over-sized pond, if you ask me.',\n",
       " b\"Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to.I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood film was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens.The amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either,the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out.Maybe it would have worked better as a short film.The actors a poor,the direction is weak and the plot is non existent.I can see what the director was trying to do,the homage he was trying to pay,but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here. 4/10\",\n",
       " b'After a long period of time (maybe 15 years, maybe more) I have finally seen this film thank you to the internet (and some unknown friend who put it \"in the air\"). It\\'s interesting watching a feature that you have been years reading about; in this case much more to knock it down as a an anti-communist pamphlet with no interest. And like many films along cinema history this is a great and surprisingly unknown film, typical of the best period in McCarey\\'s career, which it means that it\\'s a perfectly edited, wonderfully rhymed, gracefully shot film. It\\'s almost a perfect portrait of American families in the 50\\'s, better (and before) than Nicholas Ray\\'s \"Rebel without a cause\" and the consequences of generation affairs between father and sons, between the America coming out of a war and the new country that looks upon the future. Remarkable cast, perfect Robert Walker and Dean Jagger and moving Helen Hayes.',\n",
       " b\"What a load of toilet this film was. I've seen it twice now and I really cant say anything nice about it other than the sex scenes were okay - but more on that in a moment.  Based on Bram Stoker's novel The Jewel of the Seven Stars (itself not a very interesting book) this tells the story of blah blah blah. Quite frankly, after ten minutes I couldn't care less. The acting is total nosh and you never really understand anything that goes on.  *** Now for Spoilers *** Now the sex scenes: how can that fat bloke pull so many babes? Come on, they're only fillers to keep you from turning off.  And what's with that humping in the bath got to do with anything? Why is that maid spying? Who is getting rogered in the tub? And why does the door handle bleed? If you're thinking about this film, just don't. Get the slightly better (but not by much) Hammer Horror Blood From the Mummy's Tomb.\",\n",
       " b'There were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how stifling ones culture can be, and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you.  The dancing was just a vehicle for saying \"do what you love even if its against the norm\". Rather Billy Elliot like I would say. I enjoyed that film as well.   The humour was well timed, and the touching moments felt so real, you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl!  The actors all did a wonderful job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that I missed on the first viewing. Good entertainment!',\n",
       " b\"Lifeboat was Alfred Hitchcock's only film for 20th Century Fox. It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon. In the film Hitchcock demonstrates a fascination with restricting the action to a single set. He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. It is an approach that would bring most directors to their knees, but Hitch rises to the challenge admirably, finding ingenious ways to maintain audience interest and providing a ceaseless undercurrent of excitement.  A passenger ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat sinks in the Atlantic Ocean. Well-groomed society lady Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead, in an absolutely outstanding performance) successfully mans one of the sunken ship's lifeboats and steers it around the debris in search of survivors. She picks up various types from the sea, including injured sailor Gus Smith (William Bendix), crewman John Kovac (John Hodiak) and the German U-Boat captain (Walter Slezak) whose own submarine was critically damaged in the attack. The dynamic of the group is severely strained by the German's presence, as the other survivors contemplate and argue over whether to toss him to the sharks, or put their trust in him to steer their lifeboat to safety.  Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret. Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery. This keeps tension on a knife-edge throughout the film, and holds the viewer in suspense for the whole story. Similarly, Bankhead's casting is so unorthodox, her character so intentionally ill-fitting to the oceanic setting, that her role in the proceedings casts a strange fascination. The film has a lot of political and propagandist subtext, and many people have viewed it as an allegory of the Nazi rise in Europe (Slezak is the metaphor for Nazi Germany; the others metaphors for surrounding nations duped into believing that the Nazi neighbour in their midst is helpful and trustworthy). Whatever else Lifeboat can and can't be interpreted as, one thing is certain - it's a mighty fine movie!\",\n",
       " b'For those who have not heard much about Filipino cinema, it must be made clear that Laurice Guillen is a respected figure of Filipino film industry.She has played many memorable roles as its leading film actress.As a matter of fact her popularity and fame is not at all different from that of the other master woman director Marilou Diaz Abaya.As far as this film is concerned it is weak in many ways. For example-there is something fundamentally wrong with the narrative pattern which has overlapped many themes such as religion, greed and the need to be over ambitious.The good thing about this film is that it can make viewers aware of the tremendous pressure an average Filipino has to face when he or she is confronted with issues like religion and money.Juding all these facts, one can arrive at the conclusion that Santa Santita is an average film about globalization and how it has touched lives of certain individuals.',\n",
       " b\"Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this! The plot holds much potential for suspense. John Garfield is as almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable.  Yes it starts to sag fairly early. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more, in the end, than a love story.  It's fun to watch for Garfield, Massey, and the character performers. But it's not awfully good.\",\n",
       " b\"Even though when I buy a film like this I don't really expect good acting, story, or quality I buy them anyway just in case there is some good fighting / scenes in there. Unfortunately this one was a dud and a total waste of money. It is so bad that it is actually quite amusing in places so it gets a 2 out of 10. It is deffo frisby material but before you wang it out of the window it is worth one watch because you don't want to miss out on : What is going on with Bolo? The lead guy is a joke and is meant to be some kind of tough guy but looks like a mixture of Charles Bronson/Don Johnson/Columbo or whatever you cannot take this guy seriously.\",\n",
       " b'\"House of Games\" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert\\'s review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I had ever seen.  The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet\\'s screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. Their work, plus Mamet\\'s extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980\\'s. It is truly a must-see.',\n",
       " b'It could have been a better film. It does drag at points, and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix\\'s death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all morality tales, due to his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view), and the human condition.  Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain. In particular Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) a teacher of an \"esperanto\" type international language. Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a willing associate of the Falangists.  The Brits (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and best - if not worst - of the lot, George Coulouris) don\\'t give much hope to Boyer\\'s cause (which he soon grasps may be Britain\\'s before long). Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald\\'s and Stanley Baldwin\\'s governments during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical Col. Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general.  The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can\\'t really. She\\'s an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord. It was Bacall\\'s second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career. She does act well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a fine actor, but he\\'s not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again, and her star resumed it\\'s ascendancy.  It\\'s a bleak film (as was the novel). Boyer\\'s mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives.  With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). It is well worth watching to catch the Warner\\'s lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction.',\n",
       " b'Weak, self-indulgent, misfiring at every step. I hope everyone had a good time making this mess, because the end result is not worth seeing.',\n",
       " b\"There are some exciting scenes in this movie but in general it is second-rate. The shoots are overextended, the characters are not life-like and some actors don't perform well either. I also didn't like multiple nationalist statements which have nothing to do with the plot. I guess the director intended to make his characters mysterious but instead they came out to be unnatural. We are supposed to see how different people successfully struggle with hard times in their lives. But two stories, the one of Carlos and that of Mikel, end up with nothing and the third, the story of Ana, makes a turn without any reason. The movie is very depressive but without any message that derives from it.\",\n",
       " b'A film with very little positive to say for it.  Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.  Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen \"that\" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.  It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don\\'t know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it\\'s fine. We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.  And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary \\xc2\\x96 and also if they\\'re meant to be an acre big then make them so.  There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson \\xc2\\x96 the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on \"medication\".  With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? He\\'s six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene. Bad plinky plonk \"horror\" music fails to add atmosphere.  Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.',\n",
       " b'I LOVED GOOD TIMES with the rest of many of you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The writers on THIS show were fantastic and the Actors were beyond TALENTED. To answer Strawberry22 (the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary)...What happened was that James was killed in an accident (I believe I remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident) and it was the saddest episode (when it first aired and I was a tiny thing...it was so sad to me..).  Florida and the Children actually get out of the projects and EVEN become neighbors with Willona (Wilnona) and that is how the very last show ended.  ALL of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams. It was a wonderful ending and I cried because I was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that I actually believed in their fate. I hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many.  A great show and many other great shows followed including Benson and The Jeffersons. This was an awesome period for African-American television and the best writers were awesome at that time. TV LAND is Awesome for the memories and I just LOVE it because I cannot STAND the junk that we are watching today. SOMEBODY...bring back the 1970s and 1980s quickly...your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material.  Love, a TV LAND original sitcom junkie of the 70s and 80s (as they sing in \"ALL in the Family\"...those were the days......',\n",
       " b\"The first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie? It is a shambolic , embarrassing, pathetic atempt to carry on the Omen franchise. When the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the film gets worse! I dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a E - for it when they took it back to show their teacher! It is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original Omen it beggers belief. The acting is laughable , especially from the leading lady Faye Grant. she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh? It's hard to tell. THE worst sequal i have ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'I noticed that the overall IMDb rating for this film was a lowly 3.2. This seems a bit unfair. The story is good, not great, and may at times be bit predictable. But the acting is quite good with a very sympathetic performance by Tom Skerritt. Robert Davi shows a warm side in much contrast to the \"heavy\" he played in a James Bond Film. Wendy Hughes couldn\\'t have been more cold and calculating in much contrast to the warm and loving character she played opposite Peter Falk in \"Happy New Year\" or the playful character she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in \"The Heist.\" Lastly, Zalman King as a filmmaker has tried to elevate the adult genre to an art form. If not familiar, try to see his most successful series: \"Red Shoes Diaries.\" Sometimes you can catch an episode on late night Showtime.  It might be said that not every film is meant to be \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"Citizen Kane.\" There\\'s nothing wrong about a shoot-em-up western where the gunfighters never seem to run out of bullets. And although \"The Fast and the Furious\" may never make IMDb\\'s top 250 list, it was a good enough film for the producers to make two sequels.  It\\'s all about entertainment and since the world\\'s population is so diverse, we all like different types of movies. One could guess that some viewers who are offended by nudity may have been \"turned off\" by this film, which also may account for the low 3.2 rating. But the film is worth a watch.  Finally, Nina Siemaszko is excellent in this film. She brings across her vulnerability, frustration, disappointment, etc. Her performance must have been good, because other producers noticed and she had a nice supporting role in \"The American President\" and a recurring role for 3 or 4 years on \"The West Wing.\" On a personal note, I would urge all of us to respect the IMDb and the lengths they go to provide this forum. Let\\'s give fair comments to all films we view. We may actually affect the careers of some of the industry people.',\n",
       " b\"I thought that Adrian Paul could improve his chances at the movies since he did a superb job of acting in the Highlander Series, unfortunately I was wrong. I do mean wrong. This movie is the worst thing I've seen since I watched Barney. I couldn't find a single thing to like about it. The plot could've been written better by a child of six years. The entire movie screamed for help. The amount of real dialogue could've been crammed into the first five minutes, anything else said was either cursing of strange things questions on the part of Paul's character. The only good scene in the entire film is the shot of the woman and her daughter laying dead in the snow, for a moment you get a glimpse of an actual movie. Of course it's the scene where everyone is quiet and no one is moving, and Adrian Paul's doing voice overs. I couldn't even stomach thirty minutes of the film with out feeling as if I could cry. It's a shame anyone was allowed to make such a movie. Please do not watch this. Of course I am mostly complaining about Adrian's shift to bad acting, we want more Highlander, but no more movies like Breed.\",\n",
       " b\"I stumbled across this masterpiece on the TV. It was an accident and I ended up admiring this film for its sheer attempt at portraying a realistic world. Great movie for intro to fun films of the 1970's.\",\n",
       " b'For a cheesy, devil-driven thriller about a murderous car that runs down its victims, one may be unprepared for director Elliot Silverstein\\'s surprisingly intense prologue (with two kids on bicycles meeting their grisly fate on a mountain road). It\\'s a gripping, savage sequence that reminds one of the opening in \"Jaws\", as Silverstein probably intended, but what does he give us next? We\\'re introduced to small town residents and James Brolin as the local law, and \"The Car\" quickly runs out of petrol. Writers Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack had a pretty good idea here, but perhaps their original work was compromised by Hollywood and the then-fashionable occult angle. Too bad. *1/2 from ****',\n",
       " b\"Good story. Good script. Good casting. Good acting. Good directing. Good art direction. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. Good everything. Put it all together and you end up with good entertainment.  The shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days. We may count ourselves lucky that writers/directors like John Hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices heard.  Whenever I notice that I'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying I have to conclude that something about that film is right.\",\n",
       " b\"A cocky, jerky, hyper-active/rambunctious test pilot (Quaid) who never outgrew his high school jock phase is miniaturized with the intention of being injected inside a rabbit, but when things go awry due to terrorist interference, he gets injected inside a man instead, specifically a hapless grocery store clerk (Short). With the bad guys hot on their trail and time running out before the pilot suffocates, the clerk must gain the trust and help of the pilot's unhappy girlfriend (Ryan, Quaid's real life ex-wife now). Naturally, over the course of their adventure the male bonding scenario results in the clerk getting in touch with his inner Rambo while the pilot learns that there's more to being a real man than just being overly aggressive and fearless.  Silly and absurd it may be, but still an engaging sci-fi comedy adventure. Well performed by the affable Short, the dependable Quaid and Meg Ryan at her cutest. The film's biggest flaw primarily is that it shows Dennis Quaid naked, and no one needs to see Dennis Quaid naked.\",\n",
       " b'I had expected something between a mediocre to average entertainment experience from this movie. Even so, it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  Starting with the narration in the beginning of the movie - as many point out, it\\'s style is wholly inappropriate. The voice and intonation lacks gravity and seriousness, and makes you wonder whether this is a children\\'s\\' movie, or perhaps a cheap nature documentary.  The child directing is poor (and/or the child casting). Several of these scenes have been edited to try to hide acting mistakes, and then dubbed, but mismatching dialog and mouth movements can clearly be discerned. Example: the scene where the two boys hold and talk about a bird.  After that, it quickly becomes obvious that two complex novels have been squeezed into a single movie. Although it\\'s full of well-known actors, they don\\'t get many lines, and there is no character development. No inner motivations or inner conflicts seem to exist and there\\'s no evolution of any characters\\' personality and beliefs over time - although there is plenty of that in the books. Those deeper motivations are part of what makes these novels interesting, as a picture of beliefs and dogmas in Swedish nobility, medieval church, and the conflicting peoples and orders present in the holy land in this period! Instead, the characters appear rather simple-minded, and longer dialog has been substituted with cheap gestures and editing that tries to fit in too much story points into too few minutes. Example: The wooden sword that Arn just happens to hold in his hand for a second as his mother is submitted to the monastery (so simplistic, and totally out of line with his character\\'s development in the book). Example: Arn steps in, on \"impulse\" and wholly unexplained, for his father at the judicial conflict.  Towards the second half of the movie I was at least hoping for well-done battles in the holy land. This turned out to be almost laughable however. Since the movie makers were unable to make any overview takes on the battle the director tries to compensate with closeups of Arn and Saladin, trying to give the impression that they\\'re looking at each other - trying to make it a profound personal connection between foes that grudgingly respect each other. But since the conclusion that there are only a dozen or two soldier extras around them, and an overview shot would have revealed the pathetic size of the battle scene, it just ruins the scene more: If you can\\'t make a scene feel naturally epic, don\\'t try to fake it with a clich\\xc3\\xa9! Given the extraordinary \"squeeze\" of story material into the 2+ hours of the movie, it\\'s a total mystery that the movie makers insert irrelevant subplots such as the prestige conflict between Arn and a fellow officer in the Templar order. As it is portrayed, that conflict adds nothing to character depth and has no impact on the plot whatsoever.  Oh I almost forgot the score. There\\'s constant music throughout the movie. It\\'s never turned off. It\\'s not *bad*, but it\\'s not overly good either. And did I mention it\\'s never turned off? It made me think of reality-TV-shows where they play dramatic music throughout the whole episode in an attempt to infuse drama where there is precious little of it. But since this movie has - at least on paper - much more substance than that, it ends up being quite distracting and it indicates the level of confidence the director and producer had in their dramatic capability.  It all boils down to that this is a strong story that can almost tell itself, if the movie makers would have just let it do so. But instead they needlessly overreach in style, substance and amount of plot points, and I left the theater feeling two things I haven\\'t experienced after a movie in years: Palpable relief it was over, and wanting my money back.',\n",
       " b'As hopeful as I was for the film, the script was very poor. None of the major plot points came organically from the characters, rather from coincidence. Some might argue that \"fate\" brings these lovers together, unfortunately there is no \"B\" story to make this theory work. Had Jason Biggs had a \"B\" story plot line to perform, this film would have been a great deal more fun.  Perhaps if there was a separate subplot for Mr. Prince and Ms. Forlani, the film might have more depth. Ms. Forlani and Mr. Prince attempt to save this work from being completely cliche with some reasonable performances, however the dynamic this script provides them is weak storytelling. These characters repeatedly meet in a series of scenes that \"magically\" bring them together. The only problem is, there\\'s no magic. Just the same scene recycled over and over again; The same two characters not taking any major action. This causes the audience to be fifteen steps ahead of the plot, and bored out of their mind. Perhaps younger \"Boys and Girls\" will find this film amusing.  On a positive note, the club scene is cool, the soundtrack is great, and the film is well cast. It just has a bad script.  Granted, this is The Drews\\' second major project. Perhaps with experience we will see improvements in their writing abilities. The great poet Rilke suggested that the young should not write romance because their lack of life experience will not allow them to write anything but the cliche. Ce la vie.',\n",
       " b'Black plastic bags of human body parts swimming in blood are found in various places in the city of Seoul in South Korea. Police investigates them and soon sees they belong to various victims and are \"mixed\" together in order to confuse the minds of those that are investigating. A mysteriously silent and beautiful female becomes number one lead for them and target of police investigation and questions and the more the film runs, the more we get closer to the truth and revealing the identity of the violent killer. Much more cannot be said about Korean film maker Yoon-Hyun Chang\\'s disturbing serial killer thriller Tell Me Something (1999) without spoiling its many surprises and plot turns coming.  Unfortunately, this film, in my opinion, and after my first viewing, has more flaws and holes than real merits in it. First of all, it is sadly too long as it runs 117 minutes in NTSC speed. That would be okay if the film had very interesting, multi-leveled, characters in it that would make the whole ride much faster and more fluent to sit through, naturally. Now the characters don\\'t develop too interestingly and also the film hasn\\'t got any real message to deliver and thus is \"only\" a serial killer horror film, not much else. Many have compared this to the US film maker David Fincher\\'s masterful tale of wickedness living inside ourselves and our society, Seven (1995), but that film is not only visually much more stunning and brilliant than Tell Me Something but also has its message and themes to make the whole piece much bigger and more noteworthy. I felt very bored during many scenes of this Korean film as they don\\'t give anything to the film as a whole. They should have shortened the film by some 30 minutes without harming the end result.   The typical \"traumatic childhood thing\" feels also pretty stupid and like it was just fastly written to give some kind of a motivation for the killer\\'s act. Traumatic childhood and horrors related to it is a very serious subject matter in cinema and in a film like this, it feels a little unnecessary and also even repellent. If they had given a more interesting and different explanation for the killer\\'s acts, it would be more interesting to watch even in this too long form.  The positive things are also there, fortunately, and especially the few shock scenes (like the head on the seat of the car) are truly effective and done with great fast editing and merciless elements on the soundtrack. Worth mentioning is also the \"kubrickesque\" elevator scene that has a remarkably effective soundtrack behind it and making it stronger. The silent scenes and especially the face expressions and eyes of the female lead are also very impressive and once again show how much more powerful cinema can be without words, silently. Also the scene inside some industrial building (followed by a brutal murder) is effective and uses the daytime setting, empty room and distant sounds in the sountrack very effectively and gives also a strong feel of loneliness in such a big city. If they only had wanted to give us more than just murder mystery with this film of their\\'s..  The graphic horror elements are very strong in this film, and the nastiness of them even surprised me. The film opens with a grisly depiction of dissection and nauseatingly realistic body parts and blood, which are shown for several seconds in close ups without any other reason. Similar scenes follow and the film also includes one of the nastiest highway multi car accidents I\\'ve ever seen, and that is definitely an unusually horrific scene! Also, equally sudden and nasty is the elevator scene and these scenes involving bags full of body parts are as graphic and slippery as they just can be so the film makers seemingly wanted to deliver plenty of gore with this film. It all comes also a little gratuitous as sometimes the real suspense and other more noteworthy horror elements suffer and leave on the background due to these easier scenes. The film includes also one brutal killing that definitely belongs to the mentioned category of being noticably calculated. The scene is distantly close to the \"impalement killing\" in Japanese Toshihara Ikeda\\'s disturbing masterpiece Evil Dead Trap (1988), a film that has wonderful soundtrack and equally wonderful (and gruesome) surreal imagery and terror atmosphere and on any level greater film than Tell Me Something.  Tell Me Something has potential but doesn\\'t use it as near as completely as would have been preferred. It will probably please most \"slasher and horror fans\" that like their films bloody and mysterious, but if you\\'re looking for a more intelligent and effective (both mentally and physically) piece, then it will probably come as a more or less slight disappointment as it came to me. Still, due to its few merits and overall Eastern status (meaning there are NOT any stupid lightening \"entertainment\" elements usually found in, for example, modern Hollywood horror films) make this to 4/10 category. And with capital G I would add.',\n",

       " b\"THE SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS was made into a silent film in 1919. Harold Bell Wright, the author of the story, was a popular novelist of the day, and a number of his stories were turned into films. He usually concentrated on stories regarding people who lived in mountainous regions (one hesitates to call them hillbillies as they are usually shown to be non-stereotypes). As was mentioned in another of the comments here, Wright also wrote the story that was the basis for the Henry Fonda / Fred MacMurray film THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE.  John Wayne is not the central figure of this film, although considered the star nowadays. In reality this film should be considered one of the best in the career of Harry Carey Sr. A leading movie cowboy actor in the silent period and early sound years, Carey had slowly moved into character parts after 1933. Possibly his best recalled non-western role is the Vice President of the United States in MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON. As a Western star, he proved to be Wayne's own model of the perfect western film actor. In fact, in the shooting of John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, Wayne purposely honored Carey by copying a mannerism he had (holding his arm with his hand in a particular position) in Wayne's last visible moment in that film.  In the movie Wayne is a member of a family centered around James Barton and Beulah Bondi (Wayne's blood aunt), and his cousin Marc Lawrence. Bondi has never forgiven Wayne's father for abandoning the family, and indirectly causing the death of her sister. She has instilled in Wayne a hatred of the father. At the same time, the death of the sister is tied to the other tragedy of the family - that Lawrence is a mute. He has been unable to speak since he survived the fire that killed his aunt (Wayne' mother). The only one who occasionally stands up against Bondi's vicious hatred is Barton, but he admits in his best scene in the film that he really lacks the nerve to openly condemn her behavior.  This is a great film for character actors. Besides Barton, Bondi, and Lawrence, please take note of Marjorie Main in one of her most prescient performances. She is blind, and she requires expensive surgery to have a chance for the restoration of her sight. At a critical moment Carey will lend her the money for that surgery. When her eyesight is restored everyone in the community rejoices, until Main recognizes somebody in the crowd she did not expect to ever see again. Her comment when she reveals this person's identity, and realizes the tragedy she may have unwittingly caused, is devastating in it's simplicity and ironic truth.  Carey is a newly arrived rancher in the area, who (as witness his assistance to Main) gets involved trying to do good for his neighbors. And all usually benefit. Yet he too has his secrets, and they nearly rip him and several others apart.  THE SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS is a movie about redemption and forgiveness, and it's cast shows the difficulties faced by common people when presented with these seemingly simple acts of behavior. All of the stars of the movie gave first rate performances in it, and for Wayne it was the first big follow-up to his overnight success in STAGECOACH. But the best performance remains Carey's, who in the end has to commit an act of violence in order to try to save his last chance for acceptance from those who count the most.\",\n",
       " b'ASSAULT! JACK THE RIPPER is one of those films that just ain\\'t gonna be everyone\\'s cup of tea. It\\'s brutal in it\\'s depiction of rape and murder and has pretty much no redeeming value in terms of \"entertaining\" cinema - and that\\'s exactly why it is such a \"classic\" of the pinky genre. At a time when many other pinky films dealt with sleazy subject matter in a more \"fun\" and tongue-in-cheek manner, ASSAULT! went straight for the jugular, or more appropriately, crotch...  Two restaurant co-workers realize their penchant for brutal rape and murder after a mishap with a whacked-out hitch-hiker. As the two find that murder is their only aphrodisiac - things get out of hand. They continue to \"feed\" off of each other and pick up random strangers to do their \"business\" with. Homeboy finds that he has a thing for stabbing the victims in the cooch - this appears to be his major \"turn-on\". Homegirl starts to get a little to clingy and jealous when she realizes that he\\'s been doing some \"moonlighting\" on his own. This all results in the end of their relationship, among other things...  There\\'s nothing really comical or fun about ASSAULT! (except for the strange disco soundtrack...). It appears that the main goal of this film is to shock and disgust, which it does appropriately enough - especially for it\\'s 1976 time-stamp. Although the crotch-gouging is not \"graphically\" shown, the sound FX and inference of what\\'s going on is enough to be disturbing. This is a rare film as it predates a lot of more sadistic films that became notorious throughout the late 70\\'s through today. Again, not a film for all tastes, but for those that are looking for something a little \"rougher\"...this may be the one. 9/10',\n",
       " b'As the paramour of John F. Kennedy and Sam Giancana, Judith Campbell Exner had enough goods to bring down the Kennedy family and the Presidency itself. But, you\\'d never know it by this. What should have been a hum-dinger was a snooze, our \"heroine\" whining to her wuss of a boyfriend to order the FBI to stop camping outside her house and barging in whenever they felt like it. The dialog was a hoot: when Judy wails \"I want to be with you. I want to go to a soda fountain and drink vanilla Cokes!,\" I couldn\\'t stop laughing!  Judy tells us about her \"mistakes,\" as if she\\'s been kicking herself over them, only to say that she doesn\\'t regret a thing! Why was Giancana - here, the kindest mobster ever - crazy about her? There certainly isn\\'t anything about her that justified such puppy-eyed devotion.  Exner\\'s last years were bittersweet: she was reconciled with the infant son she gave up for adoption, and some of her story was verified. However, like the other good-time girls before and since, her 15 minutes clearly lasted 14 minutes too long.',\n",

       " b'The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool.',\n",
       " b'Clich\\xc3\\xa9 is the key word here. The computers that have no basis in reality, except for a few screen shots from Macintoshes; the \"kooky\" hacker types who wear Battlestar Galactica-inspired jackets and New-Wavey clothes; the evil villain and his secret-service style minions; the edgy attraction (are they gonna get together by the end?) between the two main characters, etc. Stylistically, it doesn\\'t even seem relevant to mid-90\\'s hacker culture at all. One wonders if there was any research involved in the script. The computer operating systems are more like Tron then what they really should be, which is a bunch of Windows or Unix machines with boring information displayed in a pedestrian and boring manner on regular CRT\\'s. The plot is very predictable and lacks any suspense. You know how it\\'s going to turn out. This would have made an OK made-for-television flick.',\n",
       " b'I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of \"real\" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda.   As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert\\'s contributions. True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the \"consciousness\" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (\"consciousness\") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay \"Politics and the English Language.\" To refer to \"consciousness\" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as \"based in science\" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states \"democratic republics\" and Hitler when he called his party a \"socialist workers\" movement.  I don\\'t claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah, but we Americans do love \"instant enlightenment,\" and that\\'s what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).  By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several \"expert commentators\" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention J.Z. Knight, who often speaks in her \"Ramtha\" voice. (I\\'m always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old Atlantean superman\\'s grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I\\'m the creator of \"good\" and \"bad\" advice, so it\\'s all my fault, not Ramtha\\'s.)  What a mess.',\n",
       " b'The Developers took a huge chance in releasing a demo for Prey which employed most of the game, and it paid off, big time! I enjoyed Prey because it was not hard or too confusing. Fast paced and with the all important objective to reach, this game seems to have it all. Graphics wise Prey is up to date, I guess it compares well to the likes of F.E.A.R, doom 3 and everybody\\'s favorite, Halfe-life 2. But this is where the similarity ends apart from the Alien weapons you get to Mame and kill with. The biggest feature to my mind is the use of physics in the form of Gravity. Isaac Newton would be astounded. Wall Walking upside down if you please and reverting to a spirit state where you can indeed walk thru walls and invisible (to the human eye only) structures. I enjoyed it thoroughly but not for its shoot and kill aspect but more for its original storyline. I would describe it as \"Area 51\" meets \"doom 3\". I guess for me, the true sign of a good game is one that you are looking forward to continuing on with and maybe playing again at a later date. But for my money the obvious reason is that this game has been well developed, probably game tested over and over to bring a game that is satisfying and bug free. Although my system is of the high end type, a lot of games still fail at some stage, not Prey. This was the exception to the rule and I thank the Developers for spending the extra time on making it this way. I\\'m looking forward to \"prey 2\".',\n",
       " b\"Both parts of this series were ridiculously good IMO. They were directed, acted, written, researched with what seems bordering on obsession of perfection.  That being said...why the hate? It seems this is about as good a film you can make and not get any academy recognition for it. We're more than happy to reward the standard George Clooney acting genius that rivets us (Syriana, Micheal Clayton, Up in the the Air), the display of excessive violence and insanity (There will be Blood) or the Tragic Heartfelt Love that overcomes poverty (Slumdog Millionaire) But for some reason, we seem unwilling to reward movies that are superbly made simply because WE personally don't find their message appealing to our emotions.  This story is told almost flawlessly. The only movie I can think of that accomplishes their story better is the Shawshank Redemption.  The look into Che is also a contrast to American assumptions (especially today when everyone is clamoring about how we're becoming a communist state)\",\n",

       " b\"I read the previous review, and I thought I'd have my say.  For me footsteps, is an excellent film. If Hollywood violence and sexy performances are what you're after then possibly this film isn't for you. What footsteps delivers is one mans journey through darkness.  I commend Gareth Evans for this film, I don't quite understand what the previous comment meant when they said it was amateurish, for me this is one of the best films to be shot on DV. Excellent in style, and while the pace of the film does start quite slow, it does draw you in, I thought Nicholas Bool was fantastic in it. If your expecting Tarantino Esq dialogue and charisma then yes you'll be disappointed, but Evans has clearly not set out to make that sort of film and I thought he got an excellent performance out of Bool.  It has some heavy violence, and no its not pretty its horrible, but Mr Evans is clearly not setting out to make an exploitation picture here, he presents this dark world as, well dark. I believed I could have been in the scene, it was that realistic.  The film has won awards and rightly so, while everyone is entitled to their opinion I personally believe the last review was a poor one and that this is a film to be commended.\",\n",

The prejudice all over the world needs so much more of this kind of knowledge. Here in Brazil I hope it helps to start for sure the fight to assure everybody the same rights, cause we all have the same duties and it is not fair to have this mistake for homosexuals. One day in a near future some people will see how much we struggle to be equal in all matters. Looking back having this work done to help future generations how was hard and tough to change societies and rules created by human beings who use the name of God in vain. I hope tomorrow will be a better place for my son and grandsons. This movie is for the present and the future. Great Work!!! These are some words from a human being touched so deep by this piece of images putted together to make history come through and help to make everybody understand everybody. Some dream! Uh! However, it can come through anytime we just need to want. As Jesus said everyone should love your brothers and sisters cause we all are! Truly yours, Lucy from Brazil',\n",
       " b\"Yes, it has some of the usual corny cliches of made-for-TV movies, especially ones made in the 70's. Yet all in all, it's a very decent movie and I would recommend it to high school sex ed. classes. Much better and more hard-hitting than the usual TV movies that simply just exploit people and their situations without adding any depth or insight. It's a very realistic, honest, gritty portrayal of the struggles of teenage motherhood. There doesn't seem to be a lot of movies out there on this subject, so this little gem is unique. Certainly better than the awful 'For Keeps' with Molly Ringwald that came out in the late 80's. That one was sooo badly written and had the worst dialogue.\",\n",
       " b\"To be honest, this film is basically a very poor rip-off of Finding Nemo....  and is no where near as good, funny or entertaining, nor is the animation up to the same standard.  The plot is roughly the same, although this time he doesn't go after his parents - even the voices sound alike!  I really recommend that you don't go and see this film - even little kids who have seen other animated films (such as Finding Nemo, Shrek, Shark Tale, Over the Hedge, Madagascar, etc) may turn up their nose at this one.\",\n",
       " b'\"The Godfather\" trilogy and \"Goodfellas\" owe a lot to this gangster film that preceded them both by at least fifty years. \"The Public Enemy\" was perhaps one of the first mob films that followed the rise and fall of a gangster and showed not only the implication of his actions on himself but on his family as well.  The film is far from perfect. The first ten minutes of the film in which we are shown a glimpse into the characters\\' childhood are jerky at best and feel as if much of it was left on the cutting room floor. The movie\\'s incessant fast pace thereafter don\\'t allow for much to sink in, but Cagney saves the day with an absolutely fiery performance. Not one person is spared from his bubbling anger and ferocious delivery.  Finally, the ending will leave you gasping - even by today\\'s standards.  \"The Public Enemy\" is a must see for any true fan of the mob movie genre.',\n",
       " b\"You don't leave the theater untouched by this movie. It reached me and didn't let go. I saw this movie five times and for those among you who missed it, be sure you can get your hands on a video or dvd.  It will stimulate al least three of your five senses...\",\n",
       " b\"Although I didn't expect a masterpiece, I at least hoped for a bit of wit, considering the writer and the cast. However, I was sorely disappointed.  It started horribly when you realised the central character was going to be using a fake Australian accent throughout the film. After that, irritation turned to despair as a feeble plot, uninteresting characters, an excruciating script and very sad jokes were unleashed on the unfortunate audience.  If you ever get a chance to see this film, run away as fast as you can.\",\n",
       " b\"Before I watched this tv movie I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life really was.

       " b'Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favourite of mine, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg\\'s entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And that set decoration with those \"clever\" reminders of Wagner\\'s anti-Semitism -- will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner?',\n",
       " b\"I don't think you could accuse this one of being a particularly good film, but it is fun for the genre. Slasher films have experimented with supernatural villainy with varying success and in this cheery and cheesy item, a ouija board unleashes an evil being, who proceeds to kill in reasonably bloody ways. Although this one is hard to take seriously, with a muddled script,nondescript performances and a general feeling of badness, it is enjoyable. Virgil makes for a pretty cool killer, the ending is unexpected and the gore, though cheap and occasionally of the squirt gun blood variety is fun to watch and ace in a couple of places. Basically, this is a good bad slasher that won't blow anyones mind, but is worth a look for slasher movie hounds, who are likely to be the only folk interested in this anyway.\",\n",
       " b\"Let me first start with saying I rather liked the first three seasons with Prue. This show was never supposed to be a pillar of extraordinary writing, but at the very least mildly entertaining. The characters were flat and the sexual exploitation of the beautiful actresses was very visible. After Shanon Doherty left the show went downhill. Rose McGowan had an even more restricted character, probably because the awful scripts gave her nothing to work with. She also didn't seem to have many facial expressions and her deliverance was wooden at best. The story also went downhill from here on out. The show started on a rather superficial base and went completely overboard with pointless en unimaginative story lines. Mythical creatures were introduces, the line between evil and good was all too visible. The only bad guy who ever came close to being interesting was Cole, seeing as he was evil but also loved Phoebe. All other characters were generic with them constantly reminding us that they were in fact evil (they would just come out and say it. That's just bad dialog) and the charmed ones were good (also just coming out and saying it out loud).  Needless to say, if you are looking for an entertaining show: watch the first three seasons only. The quality is terrible from the start, but at least it's watchable. After that it goes downhill until the point you ask yourself why the writers seem to have the idea that the viewers are either retarded or small children.\",\n",
       " b'Easily the most tedious film of the year and of the series and of the genre. You\\'d find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas\\' shoulders. This kind of dialogue would get you kicked out of film school. Dribbled with strained references to the original series and delivered with the verve of a George W. Bush speech on international trade agreements. The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor\\'s continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness. The \"romantic\" leads are like being forced to watch the world\\'s least interesting high-school sweethearts pretending to have a squabble. Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.',\n",
       " b'Robert Culp (they call his character \"doctor\"...I think he\\'s a vet or something) and family move to an affluent, low-tax, zero-law-enforcement suburb. Lantern-jawed Culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and \"go cruising\" through his front yard at 60mph. He presses charges, which arouses the kids\\' ire, and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign.  Marilyn Manson, er, Marlyn Mason rather, plays his fretful, boiled-celery wife, who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses, and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is getting Culp nowhere, and he\\'s not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movie people do when The System fails...(but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better).  It should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient \\'70s funk-o-matic \"teenage\" theme music that warns us when they\\'re up to no good, this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly (really!). It doesn\\'t make a big generational thing out of it. Kudos for that.  Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are \"too damn soft,\" then this flick\\'s ethos is up your alley. No, it\\'s not really \"good,\" at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word. There\\'s nothing subtle or understated or clever about it, it\\'s just sort of a feature-length PSA for vigilantism. It does, however, capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works. Remember in Frank Miller\\'s The Dark Knight Returns when Batman leads the Mutants on horseback to reclaim Gotham City? Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully\\'s face in? Remember how cool that was? Or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors? Yeah, mon.  Unfortunately, this was a 1973 made-for-TV movie that I just happened to catch at 4am on my local WB affiliate, and it\\'s probably not destined for DVD release. But after being inspired by this film, do you think I\\'m gonna just sit here and take it!?!',\n",
       " b'In terms of perspective on life, these comic-philosophic taxi rides may be the most uplifting scenes in Jarmusch\\'s oeuvre. The first of five segments (in L.A.) deals with Winona Ryder (in a broad, self-conscious performance) as a cab driver who picks up Gena Rowlands, who wants to put her in a movie. Rowlands is subtle and complex: she\\'s a rich bitch with a soft side, but we don\\'t know if she\\'s the former because she\\'s a player or if she\\'s the latter because she wants to use Ryder. What Jarmusch is going for is to contrast the social classes -- he has an obvious, unfunny line where Ryder\\'s character says she\\'s never been to the executive terminal at the airport before -- but what\\'s really interesting is seeing, since Jarmusch is usually a male-oriented director, how he handles women (one a tomboy, one in a position of power).  It\\'s obvious that the little idea of a movie about four taxi cab drivers is just a thin story that gives Jarmusch an excuse to work with certain actors, like Rowlands, whose late, great husband he adores. He goes for cultural miscommunication in the New York story (which is the film\\'s most tender and brotherly), the warring cultures within a city, where a black man (Giancarlo Esposito) who can\\'t land a cab fights with his Puerto Rican girlfriend while being badly driven around by former circus clown (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in a goofy, charming performance). Jarmusch makes brilliant statements on race and color in the Paris segment, with a sassy blind woman who\\'s aware of what her driver is thinking of her -- and who turns our expectations on their head twice, without coming back to where we started. Benigni, who doesn\\'t play the clown, is nevertheless the funniest in the Rome ride: he talks aloud to himself and outdoes and predates \"American Pie\" by almost a decade. The final, Helsinki section is the most powerful. When the cabbie tries to one-up the sob story by one of his three passengers, the conclusion seems to be that he wins; the two conscious passengers seem to think their unconscious friend\\'s troubles are insignificant, as if they can\\'t both be sad. 7/10',\n",
       " b'\"Deliverance\" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the \\'70s. While your jaw is dropped during a \"Terminator\" movie, are you really sacred? I don\\'t think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.  So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. \"Deliverance\" is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of \"trespassing\" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on \"Deliverance\" didn\\'t inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and \"squeal like a pig\" wasn\\'t a part of \"Deulling Banjos\".  I hate the term \"hillbillies\", because - as some \"users\" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of \"inbred\" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. \"Chinatown\" should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of \"hillbillies\" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their \"justice\" can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the \"justice\" in city streets. They don\\'t need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.  \"Deliverance\" was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I\\'m wrong. He was extremely underpaid for \"Midnight Cowboy\", because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. His acting in \"Deliverance\" was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it\\'s necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as \"ordinary\" today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had \"Versace\" stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. Several \"users\" have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound.  James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn\\'t stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in \"Aintry\". He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - \"don\\'t come back up here again\". Not many \"users\" knew \"hillbillies\" were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? The \"mountain-men\" WERE actually mountain-men.......  Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better \"fight-for-your-life\" in. I\\'ve experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.  That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example: it\\'s built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? They\\'re theirs.  In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from \"Deliverance\" - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it. You can have the thrill of danger - I\\'ll stick to the TV. 30-out-of-10.',\n",
       " b'This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me.  What I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some kid becomes \"The one\" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (Rihanna eat your heart out!) I couldn\\'t really discern the plot.  Bottom line: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.',\n",
       " b'Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 .  Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can\\'t be all that evil to want to kill).  They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren\\'t quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime.  Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons.  Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town\\'s police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit.  With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman\\'s rules this time.....  A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.  It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates.  This major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all.  British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker\\'s limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious.  I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman\\'s character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe\\'s preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would\\'ve added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure.  This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an \"outsider\" looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame.  If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn\\'t about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.  Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.  ***/*****  ',\n",
       " b'\"Planet Of The Apes\" an awesome, classic movie... \"Beneath The Planet Of The Apes\" a little slower paced.. but some of the scenes with the mind controlling bomb worshipers are very interesting. \"Escape From The Planet Of The Apes\" In my opinion the best of the 5, cute, funny, tragic.. excellence.  Then this came along, a mindless, boring movie. I understand the nessecity of this movie to continue the storyline, but this one gets real boring real fast. The Apes revolt from their masters in an elaborate war scene that seems to last forever in a 60\\'s \"future\" town. This one can be skipped. (Coincidently, The next and last installment \"Battle For The Planet Of The Apes\" is well worth watching, and I\\'d recommend it and all the other apes movies over this one)  ',\n",
       " b'I really don\\'t know why there are all those brilliant reviews in so many respected papers and magazines. This was a hell of a deception to me, an utterly boring (cinematography & story) display of cardboard characters played by wooden actors, esp. the highly credited Sophie Rois delivers an exceptionally bad performance. Too much of an artificial appeal to be realistic, too pretentious to be funny, too silly to be taken seriously: so the film doesn\\'t even make it to be a \"good bad movie\". Not amused.',\n",
       " b\"Aside of the always popular 'back to life via toxic waste' introduction, this is a very unique and atmospheric film. The characters are all very representative, and rather well cast. Many scenes like the music box greeting over the telephone and the exploration of the catacombs stand out as very well done, but nothing can compare to the finale: Frantic flesh eating, echoing screams, amazing special effects, and no happy, Hollywood ending. Definitely a great movie, and a good representation of the style and ability of Jean Rollin.\",\n",
       " b\"Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then I, approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage.  In all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. The motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character, not the 'Man of Bronze'.\",\n",
       " b\"I always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. It's a typical Hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn who had the supporting role of Beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. DeMille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn pull it off including longtime DeMille associate producer/actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also from the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, set directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume design team received The Buccaneer's only Oscar nomination. A great cast here from team DeMille headed up by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. At just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'(No real spoiler but hints at the direction of the episode.)  I have to agree with the statements that that this was one of the best episodes this season. The constant redirection, the outrageous things done to the boxer, not to mention the whole \"boxer trains at a brothel\" idea are some of the most creative of the season.   I really like the continuity of this season. Events and plot lines from previous episodes affect the characters as the season progresses. But every once in a while, you just have to have fun and break away from the formula. It allows both the writers and the actors some freedom from having to continue to answer questions from previous episodes, while still allowing consistent character development.  But, to my summary. I wondered where I had seen the actress playing one of the \"pleasure providers.\" I realized she was the daughter in \"What Women Want.\" She has really grown up.  EDIT: I just realized where I had seen Doris Babinkian (the \"madam\"): Sister Mary Robert from the Sister Act movies. Talk about growing up.....',\n",
       " b'HBO\\'s critically acclaimed special, \"Subway Stories,\" lived up to most of the potential its high-profile stars injected into it. Based on real-life stories sent in my NYC underground rail riders, I found myself dazzled by the situations people claimed to have experienced. The program was divided into smaller segments, each one a little story. Although you were barraged by scenarios, you could not delve too deeply into each one. That proved to be a disappointment, since some of the stories were much more intriguing than others. The other difficulty in the series was the line between heavy drama and melodrama, and the fantastical elements peppering each segment. Also some of the skits were fuzzy in meaning, leading me to believe that they were aiming too high and forgetting who really rode the subway. It was nice to see Hollywood elite in smaller, more elusive roles than usual. And the subject matter was new and exciting. You\\'ll find yourself studying that subway car a little more carefully to find your own \"Subway Story.\"',\n",
       " b'This is one of the worst of the \"Ernest films,\" starring the likeble Jim Varney. Good \\'ole \"Ernest B. Worrell\" might be a good guy - and Varney was a wonderful comedian almost all of us loved, even if just for his famous television commercials - but I didn\\'t really care for this movie.  It was mostly the obnoxious kids in here that ruined things for me. They weren\\'t in the \"Midstate Boys Detention Camp\" for no reason: they were nasty. Oh, all that is but one: the black kid, of course. The white kids are all bad. Can you say \"political correctness?\" Can you save \"reverse racism?\" Sorry to see that racial nonsense in an Ernest, but there\\'s more Liberal baloney in here, too.  Football player (and no actor) Lyle Azado plays one of the bad guys. That also tells you something about the quality of this lamebrain effort.  \"Ernest\" has a mission in this movie: \"Shaping and molding youthful minds into a focused world view.\" Yeah, right.  Still, I miss Jim Varney.',\n",
       " b'I watched the movie \"The Flock\" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies I\\'ve seen in a long while (and I\\'ve seen some turkeys.) I\\'ve never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so. I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it\\'s unbelievable. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it\\'s nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere/Danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesn\\'t believe either character for a single minute. I\\'ll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. It\\'s a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you\\'re thinking. How do I really feel?)',\n",
       " b'I saw this film when it first came out. I liked it then and I like it now. Some argue that its a little too heavy on the patriotism. But if you remember it was made at a time when we weren\\'t sure how the war would come out, the context keeps patriotism in perspective. Back then most everyone supported the war effort and the doubters kept their doubts to themselves. There were virtually no families without at least one member in the service and most of the non-service people worked in defense jobs. \"So Proudly We Hail\" was a timely film when it was made and 60+ years later its message is still relevant as an historical event.',\n",
       " b\"This movie is swimming in 1970's economy humor, there's never enough money for everything. Bills can't get paid, and a radio announcer says with relief in his voice that the cost of living went up ONLY 2%.  The humor may date it for some and make it fly over people's heads that were too young to remember the economic malaise of the late 70's (I barely remember it, my being a kid back then).  But if you get past that, what you have here is a smart and entertaining caper film where the people pulling the caper are all female. June Curtain, Jessica Lange and Susan Saint James make up the team that conspires to make a heist.  Dabney Coleman proves he can actually play a sweet guy with his turn as a Police man which falls for Jane Curtain's character. Richard Benjimin has some great one-liners playing Jessica Lange's animal doctor husband. Garrett Morris has a great cameo.  I saw this at the movies when it first came out and found it to be very funny and enjoyable. Years later I sought it out and found that it has been out of print on video for a number of years. Finally, I found a copy to rent. You should try to find a copy too. It's a fun film\",\n",
       " b'It probably wouldn\\'t be fair of me to say that this is the singularly worst movie of all time. However, it certainly does rank at the bottom of the pile.  I\\'ve read the comments published to date very carefully and seen comparisons made with classic movies such as HALLOWEEN. It would not be fair to compare this movie to such classics, however it is fair to compare it to contemporary movies made with similar budgets and similar premises.  As someone who loves straight-to-DVD movies like CAMP BLOOD and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE, I was expecting another \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" movie in a similar vain when I put SERIAL SLAYER into my DVD player. What I saw on the screen was a long way departed from my expectations.  From the opening moments, this movie was obviously going to be very poor as production values go, but this did not mean it would be devoid of all merit. Indeed it could have been an unintentionally funny variation of HALLOWEEN if placed in the right hands.  Unfortunately, this movie just got worse and worse as it moved on. There is more padding than any armchair ever manufactured. In fact, the only movie I can think of with this level of padding is HG Lewis\\'s THE GRUESOME TWOSOME. However, the director of that movie did at least make some of the padding interesting to watch in the \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" kind of way. At least 80 percent of SERIAL SLAYER consists of 3 women talking. Nothing happens at all. Hints are dropped that a stalker is creeping up on them but the producers lead this fabulous premise to absolutely nothing. As another commenter has correctly pointed out, the movie keeps stalling like a dysfunctional road vehicle. Just when it appears that something interesting is transpiring, the action comes to a halt and the seemingly never-ending boring conversations between the 3 main characters resume. Only in the last 10 minutes does anything remotely interesting happen but by this time most viewers will have given up on the endurance of watching this movie.  Judith O\\'Dea of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD fame must have really needed some money to supplement her retirement pension when she made this because this is the most embarrassing production any actress of her ilk could have appeared in. Her appearance is little more than a cameo so at least she did get out of the movie in time.  Many commenters have resorted to using the daytime conditions during which the movie filming took place as a means to defending its shortcomings. However, CAMP BLOOD was also filmed entirely in daylight and did not even have the benefit of a claustrophobic indoors setting, yet it surpasses SERIAL SLAYER by miles in terms of entertainment value.  Put simply, viewing this movie just once is the very definition of an endurance exercise and most viewers accepting the challenge are going to feel the pain every second.  You have every right to doubt my review of SERIAL SLAYER but if you choose to see it, I think you will find yourself wishing you heeded the warning.  If you want to see a movie with a similar premise, try SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE or SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE. Both movies are better paced, better acted and genuinely entertaining low-budget exercises in film-making.',\n",
       " b'\"Dressed to Kill\" has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years, but it is a true American classic, a film which is much more than just a glossy thriller.  I sincerely hope the DVD release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it.',\n",
       " b'Decoys was a very weird film, in fact my first impression, before I read the back, was that it had something to do with monsters or aliens roaming a snow covered forest, kind of like a Windego themed movie, but I was wrong. This movie was okay, but it wasn\\'t my favorite. The movie is essentially about these things that disguise themselves up to look like beautiful young college girls, who happen to have a taste for humans. This film is essentially a blend of American Pie and Alien, though there were some great camera-work for the attack scenes and there were some good performances, but this movie seemed as thought it was just another teen horror flick. There are also some pretty good comedic lines and situations too, however, for my taste it just wasn\\'t there and it did not hit me right. Perhaps, I\\'ve drawn away from this brand of horror.  The cast is virtually unknown, however, among the bunch there are notably okay performances by Krista Morin, Marc Trottier and Ennis Esmer. I think that I can safely say that the girls who played the aliens did some of the best performances. Case in point, Stefanie von Pfetten, Kim Poirier, Meghan Ory and Corey Sevier who both did pretty great acting in this movie. However, some of the \"diabolical\" acting was a bit silly and not the great. However, some of the performances by the male heroes seemed a bit too determined into finding the truth than any teen that I have run into. They seem a bit scripted and movie-ish for my taste. Also, despite it being a necessity to the film, there was a bit too much sex and nudity for my taste.  The scares in this film were okay, I enjoyed the chest bursts and the spider-things, but they weren\\'t scary, rather they were just plain weird and unexpected. They tried to be scary by having some \"jump out\" scares and \"creature\" scares, but they were unsuccessful. Though, the aftermath of which the victims\\' look like is disturbing in it\\'s own sense. I can\\'t remember that much from this movie so I regret that I cannot comment that much about the scares.  Overall, this movie had some great intentions and some okay scares but they overshot it by making it seem too scripted and adding unnecessary sex and nudity. The performances were okay but a bit too over the top and sometimes dramatic. I guess this movie is okay as a B-movie, but certainly not one that you would want to rush out and see or spend money to buy. I think that this movie would have a greater following mostly due to the fact that it is a cult classic, but not for my tastes. This movie would appeal to you if you do like B-movies and indie films as well as cult films, but if you are looking for something that will hit you hard or really scare you, keep on looking. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of this film.',\n",
       " b'First I must say that I am a big Paul Verhoeven fan and when I heard that he was directing Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon (who I am also a big fan of) I was really excited. I do not need to remind people of how terrible Hollow Man turned out to be. But this direct-to-video sequel, Hollow Man II, directed by Claudio Faeh and executive produced by Verhoeven, is actually really good. So good in fact that I am looking forward to the third installment of the franchise. The special effects, production value, performances and storyline are just as good if not better than most high-budget theatrical studio films. Christian Slater makes a great bad guy but what I enjoyed most was Peter Facinelli as the hero. Who knew -- Peter is a great action hero. This is by far the best direct-to-video horror/thriller film that I have seen in a long time. It makes me think that maybe Paul Verhoeven should hang up his hat as a director and oversee the sequels to his better films, Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers. There is no argument that those franchises need as much help as they can get.',\n",
       " b\"I completely agreed with the last comment that this was the worst movie depiction of Jesus ever. Unlike others, I did not appreciate Jesus smiling throughout the movie,,and was unable to take him seriously. I don't consider myself an expert in acting, but the actor playing Jesus was one of the worst. Its amazing to me too how many commented how closely it followed the Gospel of Matthew,,,,,yet it left out quite a bit and actually mixed up, for one reason or another the sequence of events. I have just seen the Gospel of John,,,,,,and would highly recommend it as following the whole Gospel account and being much better acted. Also the older Jesus film released by Campus Crusade in 1979 and based on Luke was much better too.\",\n",
       " b\"Considering that this film was made in 1963, in Czechoslovakia, at a time when so much sci-fi schlok was produced in the spacefaring United States, this film is a rare, welcome sight to the eyes. Intelligently produced and designed, with good character development and good special effects, I miss seeing this film which seems to have been lost in the Great Transition To Video; I know of no distributors for it. It does have its corny moments, but this is excusable in light of the time in which it was made. The ending was unfortunately changed for U.S. viewers, which is a shame; It is the U.S. ending which gets criticized most...I imagine the European ending would have been more in keeping with its originality, and would hope that American International would re-release it in the U.S., with new dubbing (I'm one of those non-purists who can't stand sub-titles...they interfere with the enjoyment of the image. And yes, dubbing CAN be done well, when done RIGHT!). It's been nineteen years since I saw it over the airwaves. I hope it has not vanished; It would be a shame for others not to experience it.\",\n",
       " b'I went to see \"Evening\" because of the cast. I\\'d gone to see \"Norman\\'s Room\" for that reason -- that movie offering Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and, also, Meryl Streep -- and had loved every minute of it. Same for \"The Notebook\" even though it was chick-flit lite. And my feeling was, anything offering performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite, simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material.  Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured. I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story...so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse. But while Vanessa\\'s character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt \"was a mistake\" was riveting, at times, the part actually showing what that \"past mistake\" was does nothing to clarify the matter. In fact, it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest \"girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy\" fashion, and in the most unbelievable, clich\\xc3\\xa9d, wrong-headed way possible.  And from here be spoilers, so bear that in mind should you continue reading.  First of all, Claire Danes was brutally miscast. Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting. Don\\'t get me wrong, she can be good in the right role -- just not this one. And Patrick Wilson was miscast, though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off. He\\'d have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played -- the rich confused WASP -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; he\\'s a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note -- \"I\\'m a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why.\" And the \"why\" (I\\'m a closet case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died (as you knew he would because that\\'s the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties) so ludicrous, wrong-headed and mishandled, I nearly threw my candy at the screen.  As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister\\'s \"perfect life,\" her sister wondering if she\\'s made the right choices, her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend (which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach might have been a more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) -- anyway, all this was hashed over in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s. And in much greater depth. Do we REALLY have to present it, again, and all as if it was fresh and momentous?  And to top it off, Meryl Streep doesn\\'t even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She\\'s still good, but only because she\\'s Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.  So to put it simply, this movie has every clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the \"really meaningful message\" movie book, and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out, again. At two hours long and laced with \"Lifetime Movie-of-the-week\" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw, it\\'s a complete failure in both the \"meaningful\" and \"moviemaking\" aspects. I give it \"3\" only because of Meryl and Vanessa.  Now, if all you require from your films is twadd le, then please set my comments about \"Evening\" aside and have the time of your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent \"Norman\\'s Room\" and find out what truly great acting is.',\n",
       " b'The clever marketeer is he is, Jess Franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava\\'s ultimately sensational \"Danger: Diabolik!\". Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert as much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. And he partially understood this very well, as \"The Girl from Rio\" revolves on a man-hating organization, led by a funky dressed lesbo, that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. The plot is rich on imagination, but seemingly only on paper, as the action is quite tame. The film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There\\'s a bit of nudity, sure, but too few according to normal Franco standards. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and I must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. Particularly the veteran actor George Sanders (\"Village of the Damned\", \"Psychomania\") is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad even he can\\'t save \"The Girl from Rio\" from being a huge letdown. A legendary Euro-smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame...',\n",
       " b'Purchased a DVD with three (3) films and this film was one of them, so I decided to see just what this film was all about. Earle Edgerton,(Tom), Judith Resnick (Laura) and Martin Barlorski (Dan) all made just this film or maybe two after this production. The star of the film was Burt Young,(Gimpy),\"Nicky\\'s Game\",\\'05 who is a great character actor and is presently making great films. The background has scenes from Coney Island, Brookly, N.Y. and even Nathan\\'s Hot Dog Stand is shown with Gloria Spivak,(Dumpy Gal) who made only this one picture and faded out from stardom. All I can really say it was a Big Joke to watch, horrible horror film and it made absolutely no sense at all. Oh, I forgot to say if you like lots of Teddy Bears to hug, there are plenty in this picture.',\n",

Ridiculous story with so many irrelevant plots going that I felt like gagging, A cult, the military, some drug dealers, a university and Tone Loc all get together and rub one out on a cookie. The C-u-m eater eats it obviously.  I wish I could find whoever decided to go ahead with this movie and punch him in the crotch. Seriously, f him.',\n",
       " b'Ill admit it.......I liked the three hours of woman chasing and obsession. Ross begins his documentary intent on the journeys of W. Sherman. Sherman was a southerner turned \"yankee\" during the civil war. Sherman\\'s march through most of Georgia and the Carolina\\'s left a painful scar of our country in troubled times. Ross parallels this scar to that of his present day life. Present day 1986 that is. And quite easily, this documentary changes tone as Ross becomes obsessed with the women he encounters on the way. At times he does jump back to \"Sherman\\'s March\", but the lure of lust and love prove to be too much for Ross.  After seeing this movie, I ask myself, What did I just see? It took a while to think about this documentary, and it opens up thoughts of life and love. I really want to know if this was calculated to document a mans love of women, or a mans love of war. Sit down, watch, and be amazed by the documentation of life in this era, by following the path of a civil war leader.',\n",
       " b\"Other comments have already said it all. This film is superb and extremely forward-thinking... today, eight years later, all of the technology, themes, and allusions still make sense. This is Lawrence Lasker's last and greatest film as writer. For those of you who don't know, he wrote WarGames and Project X, two other great techno-thrillers. But neither of those Cold War films are relevant today, while SNEAKERS still is.  Watch this movie again in the new millennium. You'll be amazed.\",\n",
       " b\"The movie is not that bad, but it's still a waste of time. It's the classic drama about a tough woman who is released from jail, gets stuck with a 7yo kid who just lost his parents and of course discovers her sensitive side... Deja-vu is written all over this film, cliches are all over the place and it's too predictable... not even Sharon Stone's well acting could save this film. I can't give it more than 4 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b\"It was nice reading the reviews for this film as so many people picked up the real elements of this movie and not just about the horror.  This movie, as most great movies, is a subtle love story, where someone realises they are a burden and maybe even a danger to them, and so make the ultimate sacrifice.  Cronenberg is probably my favourite director as he is able to take unusual film idea and turn it into something intense and believable. As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.  I think the Fly, Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work. His more recent films, Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new, but have failed as entertainment.   I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.   Highly recommend \\xc2\\x96 9/10\",\n",
       " b'This is one of those little films that one finds on the bargain bins, I found it that way, the DVD box got me hooked. Shot, as mentioned in the commentary track, for $5000. I am shocked. It looks just like the average $200,000 B-movie horror flick.   I am not saying this looks like Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a great indie horror film, with actual character development, it takes its time, that is ballsy.  Matt nelson is amazing in his performance, I mean, the guy threw himself into this role and that is admirable. A great film, great concept and a fantastic effort by Jose Cassella and his team.',\n",
       " b\"Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.  An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.  Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.  SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!  So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.\",\n",
       " b'Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan\\'s dream come true. At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life. A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored. It seems like a winning situation. And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this \"esoteric dream\" is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence. While it\\'s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project. And it is only a very few times.  You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics. But then we start seeing new footage (alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial) and that first bit of hesitation fades away. Hey, this is pretty neat! Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it doesn\\'t convince at all. And from this point on, it never ever lets up. It\\'s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was \"You\\'ll Believe A Man Can Fly\" it\\'s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here. The best effects in this are from the original productions.  Another issue with this re-cut. A lot of it just doesn\\'t make sense. The only reason any of it really works is because we\\'ve all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense. Lester\\'s Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly. Part of this could be because Donner didn\\'t get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible. What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.  After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester. The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II. That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner. But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is re-edited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing. While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.  So is there anything good in this release? Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that\\'s neat to see. In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie. But that only highlights the problems of this release. Any of the major scenes (really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section. Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances (many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used) sloppy edits and bad decisions.  Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet. Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper\\'s back as he calls for Lois and Clark? At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on? I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois. The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.  Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts. It\\'s just random action. Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates. They should have used more of Lester\\'s footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.  The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well. As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation \"XK 10\" while we all know it\\'s the \"XK 101\"! A blind man in STM knows that! The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production. For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.  The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner\\'s didn\\'t make this a separate release here in the states. As it is, we\\'re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a \"Play All\" option. It\\'s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else. I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lester\\'s version. It\\'s by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief. He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.',\n",
       " b'I recently watched this movie, and let me start by saying it is a step up from Talledega Nights, but a step down from Jolly Roger, simply because it just wasn\\'t funny. The movie had no real plot, well maybe it did, but it was one of the most base, and typical teen comedies to date. Although it did have a rather contrived sub-plot which was even worse than the already almost non existent one. Plot aside, the acting was abysmal, but better than some movies I\\'ve seen in the past (some actors were worse than others). But overall this movie was abysmal, and was just one step below \"Private Resort\", simply because Private Resort had Johnny Depp (who went on to do great things), I\\'m afraid this cant be said for this movie. Spring Break 1/10...and it doesn\\'t deserve a DVD release. It deserves to be cast into the fiery anals of hell. I got it for free and I feel cheated.',\n",
       " b\"Saw this at Tribeca Film Festival in Spring 2007, and was absolutely floored. I walked out of the theater afterword amazed at what I'd seen and thrilled that such an amazing film existed and had been maintained by a tiny number of appreciators in such excellent quality for so long.  The story is not the strong point of the movie. Rather, as with Terence Malick films, the story is just a starting point for the film, which is another beast entirely. What shines and carries the film from scene to scene is the cinematography. I didn't know if this was happened elsewhere at the time, but I didn't expect to see hand-held camera work in a 1959 Russian film, let alone the kind of early spinning, impossibly-filmed shot that appears early in the film. Later, there is a sequence that makes me long to know how they created the opportunity to film in such conditions.  If you've read this far, you must track down this movie. My understanding is that Francis Coppola has a California archive maintain the only copy in the Americas, and that it's usually shown just one a year.\",\n",
       " b'I\\'m NOT a Woody fan, but his comedy about male/female relationships makes you laugh. The subject is just as current in our post-modern, dated-you-yesterday ... dating-someone-else-today world. Too bad there\\'s the eventual bedding of Ms. Keaton which just doesn\\'t ring true. I recommend watching a Bogart film before (or with) this comedy to appreciate Lacy\\'s portrayal of Bogart. He\\'s credible! There\\'s seamless choreography in some scenes involving Woody\\'s imagined interplay with Bogart while \"real\" characters converse with Woody. My favorite line is \"I fought those guys. My face hit his fist and my nose broke his knee.\" My favorite visual is the Jennifer date that ends with the door closed on him as he talks.',\n",
       " b'This South Korean thriller undoubtedly belongs to the most impressive genre films of the last years and stands in one line with classics like \"Seven\" or \"The Silence of the Lambs\". In a way, it even tops both American movies, even though it\\'s not really comparable to them, because the story goes in another direction as the movie proceeds.  \"Tell Me Something\" starts of as a serial killer thriller clearly influenced by \"Seven\", but it becomes much more Giallo-like in the second half to become some valid social comment with its downbeat climax.  The acting is also remarkable, just as the sublime black humor that surfaces once in a while and the outrageously gory moments that will leave You gasping for breath even if You\\'ve seen many gorefests before. The last point is particularly interesting considering that the film never tries to outdo some notorious Italian horror movie of the early 1980s or Category-III-romp from Hongkong\\'s 1990s.  The diversity of interesting aspects make this top-notch thriller interesting for hard core horror buffs as well as moviegoers that normally don\\'t pay for such violent movies. Astonishingly as it may sound, it\\'s a very sensible movie in a way. Nevertheless, it surely is nothing for the easily offended or faint hearted. It\\'s just demanding cinema which makes no compromises, which most really good films are.  Highly recommended.',\n",
       " b'**Attention Spoilers**  First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the 90\\'s. It was an amazing achievement for all those involved, especially the acting of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox, and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But alas...  it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to \"Braveheart\". These are two entirely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they are both about Scots in historical Scotland. Yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that \"Braveheart\" is a better film than \"Rob Roy\". I like \"Braveheart\" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to \"Rob Roy\" is a little insulting to me. To put quite simply, I love \"Braveheart\", but it is a pale shadow to how much I love \"Rob Roy\". Here are my particular reasons...  -\"Rob Roy\" is about real people.  Let\\'s face it, the William Wallace in \"Braveheart\" is not a real person. He\\'s a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. Because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing wrong, and basically showing his Scot countrymen to the promised land. When he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.  The depiction of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it really doesn\\'t inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. That is why \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" is a better film than \"King of Kings\", and that is also one of the reasons why I think \"Rob Roy\" is better than \"Braveheart\". Rob Roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now sure, not bearing false claim against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. Let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask of him.  Rob\\'s Wife Mary, is also a normal, ambigious person. Let us start though, with how she looks in this film. Sure, she\\'s beautiful, but she doesn\\'t wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. Compare this with the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of William Wallace in \"Braveheart\". Now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). Maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy\\'s attempts for accuracy are far more effective.  Throughout \"Rob Roy\", Mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion, Cunningham. She feels compelled to tell Rob of her struggle, but doesn\\'t because she knows that Rob must seek revenge for her rape. Such revenge would surely mean the death of Rob, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.  The villains in \"Rob Roy\" are equally as compelling. Although the enemies in \"Braveheart\" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a man both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. Should he take his claim as the king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambigious character in \"Braveheart\", but from Brutus in \"Julius Ceasar\" to Fredo in \"The Godfather Part II\", these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks, although a compelling villain in his own right, is very one dimensional. He is the epidemy of evil, and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to Wallace\\'s heroism.  \"Rob Roy\" has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. First of all, let\\'s start with Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self image, that he\\'s willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. \"See to it that I am not mocked\" are his favorite words to his \"factor\". He is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great noble bearing as the Duke of Argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. He is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. He is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique.  Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators in \"Rob Roy\", and are also Roy\\'s direct assailants. Callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery. Cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the Marquis. He needs a father, little does he know that the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. He is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.  Many have criticized Tim Roth\\'s performance in this film as overacting. Hogwash I say. It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement, is Cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? We live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. \"Rob Roy\" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world.  Another character that I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary, and has a direct vexation for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully, people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule.  - The final duel in \"Rob Roy\" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in \"Braveheart\".  One thing I get tired of is people telling me that \"Braveheart\" is a better film because of the battle scenes. First of all, battle scenes are hardly original. From \"Spartacus\" to \"Gladiator\", Hollywood has had a long tradition of historical European battle scenes. \"Braveheart\" has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one important problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.  Now, don\\'t get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. In fact, there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It is one of the greatest scenes in film history. Let me explain why...  First of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is effette and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a fencing sword while Rob uses a broadsword. Cunningham fights with quick tricky movements, while Roy\\'s fighting style is more obvious.  The whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. It is powerful stuff, and it is clear that Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively,) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than 10 Cunningham\\'s. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. Good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell \"FREEDOM!\". But hey, maybe that\\'s just me.  - \"Rob Roy\" is more realistic than \"Braveheart\"  I don\\'t know that people in the aristocracy or Scotsmen talked like the people in \"Rob Roy\", but I do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that many people are bored by \"Rob Roy\" simply because they can\\'t understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, then read some Shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning. \"Rob Roy\" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90\\'s. Many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.  By contrast, the dialogue in \"Braveheart\" is hardly very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Australian? This is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. This film takes place several centuries before \"Rob Roy\", and yet they talk like the people today. Thus the reason that many people like it better. Audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don\\'t want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. Therefore, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable English accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our American language. Sure, it is clear that the Wallace is Scotish, but other than sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and a couple of \"Aye\"s for acknowledgement, the Scots in this film fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe Scots should sound.  So, do these descriptions prove that \"Rob Roy\" is a better film than \"Braveheart\"? Hardly. But if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that \"Braveheart\" is a better film than \"Rob Roy\". To put simply, \"Rob Roy\" is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today\\'s world. \"Braveheart\" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. You can make a decision on what you think is better...  Grade - A Score - 9',\n",
       " b\"Without reiterating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film...the cast/location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc...It had a vague shadow of 'Don't look Now' about the storyline from the beginning. A stay in different surroundings (Italy again) to dim the heartbreak of loss...or perhaps that's how I saw it? So consequently I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country....and I sat there and sat there....and guess what? nothing actually happens! and I mean nothing!! You are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous..You are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head...The eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys, had great scope to take the movie in another direction, the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise, the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age. It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect. When the credits started to roll (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish.\",\n",
       " b'Ticker has so much wrong with it, I am at a loss at where to begin. Really, this film has it all: bad acting, everyone from extras to lead actors seems to be in a daze as they offer up their lines. Bad accents, even Dennis Hopper\\'s. It comes and goes as if half of the movie was filmed before they decided that his character should have an Irish (?) accent. Poor production, including but not limited to, sacrificial police vehicles, at least a decade and a half old and dressed up just enough to appear as a working car before being blown up. Several rent-a-helicopters that don\\'t even get a generic \"Police Department\" sticker slapped on the side. Or, how about a hand grenade that, when detonated, erupts as a fireball instead of a shower of fragmented metal. My personal favorite though, is the late model BMW convertible that, just before exploding, turns into a not so late model BMW 4-door sedan. Also, are we really expected to believe that after so many police officers and civilians have been killed, and so many buildings in the city have been blown up, that the only person making any decisions as to how the whole situation is handled, is Joe Spano\\'s beleaguered captain. I ended up giving this film a \"2\" for two reasons. The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof. Secondly, I gave it a \"2\" because, no matter how unlikely it seems, there is probably at least one movie that is worse, and I\\'ll need to have the \"1\" available for that.',\n",
       " b'There is nothing to like about this movie. Even the much talked about sex scenes start to get boring, since they are so gratuitous and repetitive. The film is poorly scripted and none of the psychological reactions of the characters ring true. No one could take seriously the character of Lorenzo the novelist who writes such juvenile autobiographical stories. And what about the plot holes and loose ends? Why the hell does the family dog suddenly attack the young girl, with whom it had lived for years? What purpose does it serve to leave open the fate of the babysitter, her mother and Carlos (who literally disappears down a hole)? The movie tries to be deep, but fails embarrassingly.',\n",
       " b\"I must say that I was very skeptic about this movie, especially after I watched Cinderella 2, which was really not very good. But this movie has that Disney spirit, and the songs sang by the characters from the cartoon, which is really rare in Disney's new cartoons, and I miss that. The plot is interesting, and it's also very funny, I was laughing really hard on some of the scenes. The only flaw of the movie is that it completely ignores the sequel that was made before. So this is more like Cinderella 1 1/2 than Cinderella 3, because it clearly ignores some things that happened in Cinderella 2. Anyway, all the fans of Disney should watch this cartoon, they won't regret it!\",\n",
       " b'What a load of rubbish this film is. I don\\'t know why it was called \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" as it bore little resemblance to the well-known story of that name, nor why the main characters were named Holmes and Watson because they could just as easily have been called Jones and Bloggs and be done with it - they had nothing in common with the well-developed written characters of Holmes and Watson at all. As for the storyline: dull, dull, dull. Instead of the brooding gothic horror we might reasonably expect, we are subjected to a barrage of flashy sensationalised melodrama. Yet here\\'s the most unbelievable bit - read this and weep: given the opportunity to cast Richard E. Grant as potentially the most electrifying Sherlock Holmes in decades, our bumbling Watson of a casting director elects to cast him in the role of the villain, thus relegating the characterisation of Holmes to the usual mediocrity we have sadly come to expect. Not Richard Roxburgh\\'s fault, I am sure he did his best in dire circumstances, but he does not have the physical characteristics or personality to play Sherlock Holmes - few people do, and Richard E. Grant is possibly one of them. The opportunity was there and they totally blew it. Why, oh why, oh why don\\'t producers of Sherlock Holmes films do their research, i.e. read all the books and gain a true perception of those two incredibly well developed and documented characters, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. And if they don\\'t want to do that, why do they even bother? In short, this film sucks.',\n",
       " b\"JUSTICE, or BACKLASH, was a dull and plodding TV flick about a prosecutor attempting to avoid being executed by a Colombian drug cartel. I watched it thinking it was going to be a Jim Belushi vehicle, but Belushi wasn't the star. A TV actress named Tracey Needham was, and while she was very attractive, she ain't no Jim Belushi. I didn't quite make it to the end, as I had to leave for work and I was getting bored anyhow. Charles Durning co-starred to no particular effect. While glossily photographed, JUSTICE looks like it was strictly a paycheck for all involved, including the legendary and ageless Henry Silva as Sal the Joker. And here we go again: IMDb wants more lines, God knows why. Brevity is often the beauty of a movie review. But not here. No sir-ee, Bob. You gotta drag these things out. Drag them out, I say!\",\n",
       " b'Although this movie is supposedly based on actual events, the production values of the film betray that it is yet another old exploitation film--the sort that were produced by fly-by-night production companies to prey upon the public\\'s fear AND fascination with sex and drugs. But, since such topics could not generally get past the censor boards of each state, they were marketed as \"educational\" and shown to adults-only audiences. Some of the obvious problems with the film are the use of silent film footage (when shown on a normal projector, it runs too fast and looks odd), clips of a baby being delivered by c-section (for little apparent reason other than they happened to have the film and decided to shove it into the movie) as well as choppy editing and poor acting. It\\'s obvious th was NOT a large budget production, but made \\'on the cheap\\', so to speak.  After showing a lot of seemingly irrelevant stock footage, the story begins. A Chinese man who looks about as Chinese as Eddie Murphy is talking with a couple American men. Later, one of them approaches this \\'Asian\\' and requests that they do some opium together. So, they go to an opium den and hit the pipe. While this is pretty cheesy since the Chinese guy obviously ISN\\'T, the way they demonstrate opium and the paraphernalia is surprisingly accurate compared to the information you usually get in such films. Soon you see the two drift into a blissful stupor. Later, the American guy goes back for more and he\\'s obviously hooked. How this turns him into a man who sells patent medicines is beyond me.  The rest of the film is jam-packed full irrelevant film footage--including odd clips of sideshow freaks, speeding cars and, cats staring at snakes--once again, whatever they seemed to have on hand--slapping it all together and hoping to make a semi-coherent film. And, unlike the segment on opium, the drug information is, to put it charitably, histrionic! Supposedly wild parties and a guy ripping the dress off his wife when he ran out of drugs are among the more outlandish scenes in this film--that, by this point, has become an almost plot less mess. By then end, the opium addict is a complete and total mess and he begins quoting Bible verses about the danger of alcohol--as he calls out to God and then kills himself. Believe it or not, this scene actually is well done--with some dandy acting by the addict. But, sadly, it\\'s about the only well made portion of the film! Some of the problems with the film were probably not originally in the film. Many times, the film appears to have little bits and pieces missing and as a result, the film is pretty choppy. Considering this was a Kino DVD, I assume this is simply the best copy they have as this company usually does a good job in producing excellent quality disks.  It\\'s obvious from my review that this is a terrible film. But, is it worth seeing--after all, some bad films are so stupid and clumsily made that they are fun to see and laugh at--especially with friends. Well, this film is stupid and you will laugh a bit at its horribleness--but it never quite reaches the same level of histrionics and stupidity of such cult classic bad films as \"Reefer Madness\". Still, it\\'s good for a laugh or two and probably did little to educate anyone--especially with such lines as \"Ladies, ladies...let\\'s not get vulgar...YET!\".',\n",
       " b'Who says zombies can\\'t be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of \"Fido,\" who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950\\'s where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family\\'s new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to \"life\" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.  This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series \"Lassie\" - it might easily have been entitled \"A Boy and His Zombie\" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-\\'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesn\\'t hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950\\'s itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.  K\\'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.  This is what \"Lassie\" might have been had Timmy\\'s best friend been afflicted rabies.',\n",
       " b'John Water\\'s (\"Pink Flamingos\"...) \"Pecker\" is the best movie I\\'ve seen in a while. It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions. Pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)',\n",
       " b\"One of my favorite movies, it is perfect for the romantic who has been disillusioned. This is what happens if love is taken to the extreme. It goes from perfect love to perfect hate, and you will always remember this movie. Watch it, it's definitely worth the time.\",\n",
       " b\"This really is the best road movie I have ever seen. I can almost see the folks in the drive-in waiting for the explosions and wondering what they sat through. This film is so much more than just a fun car movie. It is better than Easy Rider because it is not encumbered by all the hippie platitudes that really didn't age well and because Easy Rider is constantly telling you what it is about while Two Lane Blacktop shows you rather than telling you. It is, on the one hand, a meditation on freedom and its drawbacks. The Driver and The Mechanic are free but they are not happy. That is the price of their freedom. They trade comfort and human connection for freedom. On the other hand is the value of truth. The Driver and Mechanic know nothing but truth. They find a sort of comfort in the fact that their lives are simple and true. GTO, however, lies to everyone. His whole persona and his car are all a lie. The only time he seems to be telling the truth is when he is with the driver and in the '55 and that is the one time someone tells him to shut up. He goes on with his lies even incorporating the realest truth he ever came in contact with into his lies in the end. I guess I love this movie because it tells me a story in a way that only film can. It shows me things rather than telling me and that can truly be said of so few films.\",\n",
       " b\"I was bored crapless the other night and turning channels on the movie channels and came across this one.  I am a big fan of Irwin Allen and this is one of the few of his films I know nothing about. I'm glad I didn't, this really was one of the bad ones.  All I got outa this one was a bunch of once-great actors trying to escape a volcano..and one by one, they die -- except for a few. I just did not care whether these folks lived or died...got off the island or not...oh, my goodness.  The special effects are really cheesy, the stories were full of plot holes. Victoria Hammel looked good pre-Hill Street Blues days...and the most exciting part was Ernest Borgnine catching on fire and blindly being led across mountain ledges by older actors who didn't seem to make it either.  What a waste.\",\n",
       " b\"A complete waste of time  Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy.This movie was clearly aiming for the Rang De Basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made RDB connect with its audience_great script, terrific acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown.  Compared to that near-masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain's Persian rug and the hero's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less! All of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but movie-making has become_should have become_more subtle and thoughtful of late.  Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it! He resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans.  Even if you don't agree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much much better and Mr.Santoshi should have left the industry-bashing to Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? That's right!!Santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back-biting, bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named Sania. There are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see!  All in all, raise your voice against movies like this and don't spend your hard-earned money on this bomb.  * out of ****.\",\n",
       " b\"Jonathan Sanger directed this murky film written by David E. Peckinpah. I found it very predictable and often tedious. Watching William Devane, looking well his age and a bit older, make love to a young thing was what I found silly and not real. The young thing, played by Shannen Doherty, was infatuated with him. You gotta be kidding. Okay, maybe he had the money. But his money isn't what she wanted. This I found hard to believe. I did like Clare Carey, who played Devane's daughter, the only real value in the picture. I felt the two leads deserved each other. Both losers. As to the acting, well, I'd give them a so-so, except for Carey, whom I liked. There are better films on this subject of obsession.\",\n",
       " b'What do you get when you put the 2 greatest actresses alive today (Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn) together with the incomparable Bruce Willis and thrown in a little Isabella Roselini for good measure...you get a hilariously funny comedy that had to have been just as much fun to make as it was to watch! The effects in this film were uproariously funny and definitely Oscar worthy! The acting is unsurpassed and it is filled with comic scenes such as the one where they make Hellen Sharp (Goldie\\'s character) look a hundred pounds heavier and place her in an apartment cluttered with trash, cats, and frosting containers! How about the funny lines such as \"You paint my ass, I\\'ll paint yours!\" and the \\'death\\' scenes. How do you kill something that won\\'t die? You don\\'t but you have lots of fun mutilating her! The fight sequence where Hellen and Madeline Ashton (Meryl\\'s character) beat each other senseless without killing each other or even inflicting pain is uproariously funny! Hellen winds up with a huge hole in her stomach and Madeline winds up with a broken neck that won\\'t repair itself. Only Earnest Menville (Bruce Willis\\' character and the man these 2 women fight over throughout the film) can piece them together again! Not since Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\" have 2 such brilliant and gifted actresses been on the same screen and worked so well together to make such a colorful and masterful film...see it today, if you haven\\'t already and if you have...see it again!',\n",
       " b'My Take: Nothing more but guest stars and reused footage to substitute for laughs.   Peter Sellers has always been famous for comedy roles that would shape the ineptitude and clumsiness of comedians to come. It all started with \"The Pink Panther\", in 1962 and directed by Blake Edwards. His role their inspired sequels, with some even outdoing the original. Although Sellers had played other roles, his role as inept Inspector Closeau is one of his most memorable. The power of that role pushed director Blake Edwards to do another \"Panther\" film, a couple of years after Sellers\\' death. It was \"Trail of the Pink Panther\".  \"Trail\"\\'s story involves the robbery of the Pink Panther diamond in Lugash (once again), but that remains unsolved even after this film ends, for the real plot is the disappearance of clumsy Inspector Closeau. Wait a minute, how can Sellers play Closeau if he passed away a couple of years ago? Simple (for Edwards), throw in deleted and archive footage from other \"Panther\" films, place new footage from \"Pink Panther\" film returnees David Niven (dubbed, due to his voice lossage), Capucine, Burt Kwouk, Herbert Lom and others and poof! We have \"Trail of the Pink Panther\", all set and ready to be released.  Frankly, the film works on some bits because we love \"The Pink Panther\", and seeing those laughs again reminds us of them. But the entire film is a rather convoluted mess, mainly for the spliced in footage. What is the movie about really? Closeau or the Pink Panther? As if it mattered much. The film just lags a bit it recycles (literally) every laugh in the film.  What Edwards has done here is not a film, it\\'s just a fast way to watch the entire \"Panther\" series. It should have been called \"The \"Pink Panther\" series in 96 minutes.\" (with additional footage).  Rating: ** out of 5.',\n",
       " b'Possible Spoilers, Perhaps. I must say that \"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney\\'s sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as \"The Little Mermaid II,\" \"The Jungle Book II,\" and \"Peter Pan II,\" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame II\" and \"Atlantis II,\" but I\\'m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.\") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney \"Cinderella.\" The sequel to \"Cinderella,\" however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, \"I\\'m going to do this banquet my way!\" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, \"Ewww!\" That is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original \"Cinderella\" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn\\'t seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good. One just can\\'t leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney\\'s name. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse.',\n",
       " b\"This was the worst adaption of Hamlet I have ever seen. Ehtan Hawke's pseudo-intellectual persona is tired. During some scenes, it appeared that he was reading off of cue cards.

The Kenneth Brannaugh version is much more worthy of your time.  \",\n",
       " b'I like the actor they chose to play Bourdain, really I do, but Anthony Bourdain he is not. And that is what is wrong with this series. I read the book and was really excited to rent the series, but I should have known better. Someone in TV land decided that Anthony Bourdain is too abrasive, in your face and rude, so the show \"softens\" Tony and loses all the spirit. Yes, the real Anthony Bourdain is in your face and abrasive and is very much about How Things Really Are. That is the spirit in which Kitchen Confidential (the book) was written. So honest, in fact, that when she gets OLDER, I am going to make my 12-year-old aspiring Chef read it before she decides in fact to spend oodles of money on Culinary school. It is that very in your face honestt that is missing. Tony is nothing more than an alcoholic, excuse me, reformed-alcoholic boy scout. Yawn. Meanwhile the _real_ Anthony Bourdain has a hit show on the Travel Network doing what he does best, telling it like it is.',\n",
       " b'Well, if somebody asked me how did i like the movie I\\'d tell them I got disappointed because none of the \"revelations\" proved to be really moving (neither the history of Marcus, nor new facts on Skynet\\'s creation) but on the other hand it\\'s a nice contribution to the Terminator realm. Still, in its exquisiteness its closer to part 3 than 2 or 1. The main value that this movie presents lays mainly in the presentation of the postnuclear world. Obviously, Skynet\\'s new gadgets have been introduced and they\\'re rather interesting, though gaudy in some respects. The moment we learn Marcus is one of them our appetite increases immensely. Unfortunately, it only starts good to become really cheesy later on.',\n",
       " b'This film is often overlooked among the great war films, but it fully holds up to the best and, at the same time, transcends the genre by offering much to those interested in classic detective themes. The cast is first-rate, and thanks to an excellent script and excellent direction, avoids the classic \"walk-on\" feel of many other films that have a profusion of well-known stars. Sharif is surprisingly good as the dedicated police officer, Courtney excellent as a sensitive yet firmly grounded young soldiers, and O\\'Toole is superb as the epitome of a ruthless SS officer. Pleasance offers a fine performance--to my mind among his very best--as a conscientious and basically decent officer. Based on an excellent novel by Hans Helmut Kirst, this film offers an excellent, gritty feel to Warsaw and Paris during the period of German occupation. It is thoroughly grounded in solid historical research, likely aided by Kirst\\'s own wartime perspective. Well worth seeing!',\n",
       " b'\"Escape From New York\" is a solid action noir by John Carpenter, although it lacks the punch of Carpenter\\'s other three previous features (\"The Fog\", \"Halloween\", \"Assault on Precinct 13\"). Kurt Russell became famous for his Snake Plissken, and rightfully so, although the character seems to be only a more gritty version of Napoeleon Wilson in \"Assault\". What makes this film the cult classic it is is Carpenter\\'s very apocalyptic and brash story. This is a very dark film, and it holds up especially well today when shown against the countless fluff films that Hollywood seems to be churning out.  Carpenter made the most out of his meeger budget and created a very convincing New York City. Not only is the set design fantastic, but so are the typically strong performances. Russell, Hayes, Barbeau, Pleasence, Stanton, Atkins, Cyphers and Borgnine are all cult legends, and seeing them all work together makes Robert Altman\\'s casts look feeble in comparison.  What limits this film from greatness is surprisingly lax direction by Carpenter. The film is not as tight as it should have been, and really fails to generate any sort of suspense during the action. Deaths just happen out of nowhere, with little to no build up, which is a shame. This movie could have really been amazing. The ending is perfect though, and easily makes up for the film\\'s faults. See it for Kurt Russell and the great ending and you will come away a happy viewer. Watch \"Escape From LA\" though to see what this movie should have been.',\n",
       " b'The one sentence review of this movie is that it sucks. Pretty straight up. But no one likes the criticism \"sucks.\" They want reasons. Allow me.  CGI deer. A whole whack of them. A whole whack of unexplained CGI deer. One wonders if they couldn\\'t find horses to continue the story from the first movie so they figured fake deer was the way to go for part 2. And just to try to make it seem like it wasn\\'t 100% lame and irrelevant they toss in antlers at the Morgan homestead. Oh, well then, it all makes sense now. Or not.  Did anyone even listen to what Samara\\'s birth mother said? She tried to kill her baby cuz the kid told her to in her head. Just like Rachel\\'s son told her to in her head. To get rid of the thing inside her. So the \"thing\" in Aiden isn\\'t even Samara, it\\'s just some damn nameless thing the writer\\'s never explain beyond a casual line about some watery world beyond that possessed Samara as a baby. OK....whatever...  Samara wants a mommy. You know what I want? Some friggin Vicodine to slip me into a drug induced coma so I can wipe the memory of that lame as lame plot contrivance out of my head. But wait, it gets worse... she wants to watch TV with her mom. That\\'s about it.  Excuse me, I need to go yank some of my hair out.  This thing from some nether world that can make things happen with the power of its mind gets killed in a well, comes back from the dead through VHS tapes and murders people within 7 days of witnessing said tapes then inexplicably possesses a living boy.....cuz she wants to watch TV with her mom? Who the hell wrote that? What drooling, mittens-pinned-to-his-coat, Scooby-Doo-lunch-box-carrying, lazy-eyed, fat-necked, Lysol-huffing, ice-cream-smeared-on-his-face, laughing at the antics of Uncle Joey on Full House idiot wrote that? That is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in my life.  Does she want to kill millions? Does she want to inflict suffering on mankind? Eat the living? Make a race of obedient slaves? Reign in darkness? No, she wants to watch friggin cartoons from the 50\\'s and eat sammiches with ma on the sofa. The mind reels at the absolute idiocy.  So, to reiterate, this movie sucks. Do yourself a favour and stay away. If you hated the first one, this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in. If you liked the first one, this will make you mourn for a half decent story and a film that doesn\\'t induce bile production. And if you saw this one and liked it we clearly can\\'t be friends.

       " b'This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester\\'s character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read \"Grumpy, broody, murky past.\" He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK.

       " b'Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. In the case of \"Lucy\", the main points of Lucille Ball\\'s teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.  The main emotional points of Lucy\\'s life are made clear: Lucille\\'s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV\\'s most memorable sitcom couple.  As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one Judy Davis made when playing Judy Garland, but York makes Ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. Even though her comedic-timing is different than Lucy\\'s, she is still believable. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance during the early \"I Love Lucy\" years, but watching York portray Lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.  Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with Desi\\'s accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Zima was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged Lucy.  Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not featured much, thankfully, since Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they aren\\'t good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.  Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, the head writer of Lucy\\'s radio show \"My Favourite Husband\" which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with \"I Love Lucy\" in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! This movie also depicts Marc Daniels as being the main \"I Love Lucy\" director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the Ricardo\\'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured.   There\\'s also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953, during Lucy\\'s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher, two vital figures in \"I Love Lucy\" history? The biggest gaff comes in the \"I Love Lucy\" recreation scenes, at least a few of them. It\\'s always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! The \"We\\'re Having A Baby\" number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. By far the best was the \"grape-stomping\" scene, with Rachel York really nailing Lucy\\'s mannerisms. The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the \"Vitametavegamin\" and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that approach.  The film\\'s main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about Lucy\\'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. Overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of Lucy & Desi\\'s marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.',\n",

This is an incredible piece of filmmaking and storytelling, better and more authentic in many ways that Dances with Wolves (Dances is hyper-hokie in many places.) The last film about Native Americans that was this good was the Canadian production Black Robe.  Dreamkeeper is brilliantly directed, written, acted, executed. I'm pretty jaded watching films, but yes, I laughed and cried (okay, tears didn't actually fall, but moistened my eyes were.) The visuals are staggering. Buffalo stampedes, fights, dream sequences all believable. What's really cool is that the intertwining of the stories works so well, a current story of a grandpa telling his bored grandson Indian legends that become real flashbacks. Superbly written and shot, the director (Steve Barron, an award-winning video director) pulls all elements together and lets the legends tell themselves (okay, I'm really biased against video directors making features, all show and no tell. Dreamkeeper, however, is show and tell done well, ain't that swell?) The two lead actors, Eddie Spears and August Schellenberg don't appear to be acting, they inhabit their contemporary rolls. Each legend has it's own feel and rhythm, and are beatifully directed and edited. And it's all politically correct to boot (apparently each legend had consultants and advisers from the specific tribes.)  Hats off to Hallmark Entertainment for taking the great risk to make this staggeringly good production. It should be released as a feature, because it played incredibly well on the big screen at UCLA. Dreamkeeper is a better and more important film than anything in the theaters today. Grab a beer, fry some bread, and sit down at your own home and watch this wonderful miniseries.\",\n",
       " b'(CONTAINS SPOILERS) The action classic DIE HARD gives us what we expect.  Bruce Willis plays the character as John McClane, a tired, confused, irritated but very deadly cop who gladly kills some men to save his wife whose being helt hostage.  STORY: Christmas in town! NYPD cop John McClane has come all the way to Los Angeles just to make things up with his wife this Christmas. Holly (wife) is working in Nakatomi Plaza and there is being held a Christmas party and under that, 12 uninvited guests appears. Twelve German terrorists high-jacks the skyscraper and declares war against everything and everyone. They\\'ve expected anything...except John McClane there you see, that is running in the fire stairs with his serving gun and he\\'s p***ed off!  \"Come to the coast, get together have a few laughs!\" Bruce Willis\\' performance as the cop couldn\\'t have been done better so I\\'m not complaining about him, no - but the show gets stealed by the villain, as too often - Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. The movie ir brilliant in the most ways and entertains you perfect! In the same time being a funny movie it\\'s violent, exciting and tough as nothing else! We\\'re waiting for the fourth Die Hard movie to come, but that I think is going to be a big mistake! Without doubt the best movie in the trilogy...great and simply tough and funny!',\n",
       " b'This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I once had Battlefield Earth as the worst, but now this movie has leaped far ahead. How this is ranked even close to a 5, I don\\'t know. There were a couple instances in the movie (I saw it in a theater) where a good 2 minutes went by with no dialog during a seen where you just watched the characters. It was painful. Usually I hate it when someone talks during a movie. However, in this one, someone said \"Did they forget their lines?\" and everyone in the theater laughed. When you watch the movie you\\'ll see this a couple times. This movie is only good to watch if you actually want to tell your friends that you saw the worst movie of all times.',\n",

       " b'During the Dragonball Z series, there were two excellent movie specials that explained the background of characters with relatively unexplained backgrounds. One explained the background of \"Future Trunks\" and the alternate reality he is from, and the other tells the story of Bardock, Son Goku\\'s biological father, and his fight against Freeza.  At the end of the last episode of Dragonball GT, Goku absorbs the dragonballs and disappears without a trace. 100 years later you see an aged Pan, as spectator. at the Tenkaichi Budoukai. Her young grandson, Goku Jr. (who is the splitting image of Goku as a child) goes super saiyin and fights Vegeta Jr.  This sidestory follows Goku Jr. on his quest for the 4 star dragonball so he can use it to heal is sick grandmother. Goku Jr., interesting enough, a coward. Its a nice twist and makes for a better story to see a Goku who can\\'t fight and isn\\'t brave enough to stand his ground. This leads to a few comical instances when you get to see a sobbing, runny nosed Goku running for dear life.  As you can probably guess, eventually we see Goku Jr. lives up to his name, but not until after a brief word of advice from his hidden guardian angel. This special is great addition to the DB collection of movies. Its has the classic goof ball comedy of the early dragonball stories, without a lot of fighting (so if thats what you\\'re looking for in a movie, watch one from the Z series). It shows your a possible new main character for a new series; one who can fight like Goku, act as stupid as Goku, turn his enemies into his friends like Goku did, and most importantly, one who eats as much as Goku did.',\n",
       " b\"I'm in awe! Wow, prepare to be blown away by the uncanny ways of the ninja. Watch them as they pounce, crawl along the ground (on their backs or stomachs) like a caterpillar, fly through the sky, climb buildings, hide and spring from trees, throw about ninja stars, role out blue welcome mats, disappear in smoke bombs, make a lot of swoosh noises with their blades and quickly sneaking or trotting about on their toes. What a sight! Really I could go on about the many traditional actions, but I'll be here all day. Oh not to forget we even get the legendary Chuck Connors popping up now and again, and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease. What class! What a badass! Anyhow the ultra-cheap 'Sakura Killers' is some stupid, but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b-grade debacle.  A genetic lab in America has a very important video that's stolen by a couple of ninjas. Two Americans are sent to Japan by the Colonel (Chuck Connors) to retrieve it.  The opening of the feature sets it up nicely. Get ready for the laughs! Afterwards it slows down, but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula. This is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play. It's not too shoddy either, (like the moronic script and daft performances). The final climatic showdown is very well done.  In the slow stretches it has the two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) looking in to the case, sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems. What made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were. These were supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is. He centres the on-screen activities around striking Taiwan locations. The score is a chintzy arrangement.\",\n",
       " b'\"Scarface\" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.  It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind \\'The Godfather\\'.  But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like \\'The Godfather\\' or \\'Goodfellas\\'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as \"tackiness\" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the \"remake\"!   Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana\\'s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn\\'t really think much and gets angry all the time!  There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including \\'Gina and Elvira\\'s theme\\', \\'Push it to the limit\\' and the title track instrumental.  There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony\\'s visit to his mother\\'s.  About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what \"Scarface\" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn\\'t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn\\'t be as effective without him!  Steven Bauer shines as Tony\\'s friend Manny.  Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony\\'s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.  Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.  The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.  \"Scarface\" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!',\n",
       " b\"I think the problem is too many people are comparing this movie with other movies and failing to realize thats its not SLC Punk or Fightclub. Anarchist Cookbook deals with a more philosophical and physiologically aspect of Anarchy over anything else. The whole movie starts with comparing Hippies to Anarchy, the idea of accomplishing anarchy by means of peace, respect and intelligence. Puck believed that was Anarchy, then Johnny Black shows up and basically takes that whole concept and says it will never work. Johnny Black was right in sense too, the fall of the system could never be acquired by means of peace. Johnny Black believed the only way to bring down the system was to use violence, aggression, and destruction. This meant going out and openly attacking the system by aggressive vandalism, attacking people, and altering peoples judgment by addiction. The movie does this by comparing Johnny Black to Nazi's, and rednecks. Puck not only didn't agree with this method, but it also opened his eyes to the truth of Anarchy, and thats why in the end Puck just left the scene. He knew the truth and he knew the real decision to be made was not to how to carry out Anarchy, but weather or not Anarchy could be carried out.  Watch this movie if you got an open mind and are searching for a philosophical aspect of Anarchy, otherwise stay away because you'll just misinterpret it and think the movie makes no sense.\",\n",
       " b\"I loved this movie and searched for it for a number of years. All I could ever find was the pal format. It was released in Pal format. So if you didn't have a Pal player you were out of luck. I bought the Pal format on ebay from someone in the UK for a high price thinking I would find a player, but that never happened. Someone did contact me after my sale and offered to sell me a DVD of the movie which I accepted right away, I watch the movie at least once or twice a month. It always makes me laugh! I fell in Love with Treat Williams the first time I saw Hair. I didn't know that Treat Williams doesn't like to admit he was in this wonderful movie. I have about everything he was ever in. I wish they would release some of the other wonderful movies of that time period.\",\n",

       " b\"Narrated by 'Oggi' (a boy who does not exist and may or may not ever come into existence) this sad, philosophical, hilarious film recounts, disjointedly, the almost random conjunction of events that lead (or don't lead) to Oggi's coming into the world. Lightning strikes multiple times; people keep bragging about the quality of their mobile phones; a farmer and his wife aboard a tractor burst into a lively lip-sync of 'I Will Survive'; good Samaritans keep stealing things; a doctor tries to end his life; cops simply can't get a break...this movie is full of seemingly random events that somehow crazily knit together to bring us to the end that is the beginning (possibly).  This movie is suffused with the particular brand of bitter humor that seems to abound in Eastern Europe. It is not for all tastes, certainly. If you are looking for something different, something that will make you think while you laugh and think about why you are laughing, this movie is worth taking a look at.\",\n",
       " b'I saw this movie on opening day -- I was convinced by a fellow Science Fiction fanatic to see it. I still believe that it is the worst movie that I have seen (with an actual budget).  Every aspect of the movie was bad: the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the pacing, the special effects (don\\'t blame the year...there were plenty of movies that came out in the same year that had decent effects), ...the list goes on. The theater I was in started full, but did not stay that way. I was actually stunned into staying - I couldn\\'t believe it was so bad. When the movie started showing events from another character\\'s point of view, I lost it. I thought, \"Not only can you see through the plot, you get to see it twice!\" I started laughing uncontrollably, eventually slipping out of my seat onto the floor. I didn\\'t understand how the movie could have gotten any worse, but it had.   There are some who would say that you have to go into viewing this movie with an eye for camp. I would agree, except that this movie was marketed as, and had the tone of, a serious Sci-Fi flick. Also, if it wanted to be seen as camp, there should have been something that seemed intentionally humorous or at least intentionally awful (like a good \\'B\\' movie). Barring that, if the movie had been unintentionally funny (like Battlefield Earth), I might have appreciated it a bit. As it was, it was dull, dry and painful to watch. The only entertainment I derived was from thinking about how bad it was.  I\\'m fine with time travel paradoxes, and can even overlook continuity issues; I was not confused at all by the plot. I just believe that this movie was uninspiringly bad.',\n",
       " b\"This was the most touching movie, I loved every thing about it. I find it very hard to believe this movie has been taken out of circulation. I know its out there somewhere. My husband and children deserve to see this movie,and I've vowed to find it somehow. The actors,the music,the script were all exquisite and I can remember even as a young person the profound effect it had on the way I viewed and still view the value of life.  \",\n",
       " b'A very good comedy, able to refresh anyone under heavy stress, acting three good stars Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and the \"cowboy\" Randolph Scott, who in fact did a little as a supporting actor. Irene is a dead wife who came back to her home and family, and found his husband (Cary Grant) married to another nice lady. However, Cary simply loves his real wife, so the problem was how to get legally rid off the new wife and to come back again to her real one. The law, obviously, has the last word in this matter.',\n",
       " b\"It seems like we're supposed to hate this one but I loved it, I'm sorry but there you go.  Maybe it was because it came out at the time when punk had just happened. To me the book & the movie were such a break from the usual stereotypical pro-authority nonsense we were being regularly served up at the time (and sadly we seem to have gotten back to these days).  Naturally the book was, by far, the better experience (a genuine 'laugh out loud' read to be highly recommended) but nevertheless I found both hilarious and a long overdue reality check on the forelock tugging blind belief in benevolent and always virtuous 'authority' (something which applies well outsides of the confines of any Police unit too).  I think it's a real pity we seem to have lost that very healthy irreverence & scepticism and are today saddled with way too much haughty hard-faced tedium and an expectation that we blindly trust authority figures.\",\n",
       " b'This is one of those minor, but very enjoyable pictures that can easily slip by unnoticed. It isn\\'t easy to find, and most Film Noir enthusiasts are familiar only with the title. But \"Crime Wave\" deserves to be seen by fans of the Noir or crime film genres. It\\'s a terrific example of the lower-budget type of dramas that studios were turning out in the 1950s. The only major star is Sterling Hayden, who gives his usual acceptable performance, here as a disgruntled law enforcer. Gene Nelson, probably better known for musicals, is an interesting and successful choice for the protagonist, a man caught between good and evil. There\\'s also an entertaining tough-guy type played by Charles Bronson.  What really distinguishes \"Crime Wave\" is its extensive use of Los Angeles locales. Apparently, location shooting was done to save money on sets, but with the passage of time, movies like this become documents of the way a city looked and operated in a past period. A number of scenes take place on busy LA streets and they lend a good deal of excitement to the proceedings.  With any luck, this picture will become available on video for more to see. It\\'s the kind of movie that has the effect of reading a good pulp crime novel or story.',\n",
       " b'This was Errol Flynn\\'s first film and it was made before he made it to Hollywood. This will be obvious to ANYONE once they begin viewing this terrible film. It was made in Australia and it looks more like a made for school video than a real movie intended for general release. Much of it is narrated documentary--including grainy stock film. There were also some reenacted moments concerning the Bounty and they have the same stilted and uninteresting quality you would expect for a non-theatrical release. How anyone might have seen this and seen any promise in Flynn is very doubtful--he is wooden and unengaging and only seen for a small portion of the \"movie\". It\\'s amazing that only a very short time later he was acting in the fantastic movie Captain Blood! It just goes to show you that first impressions don\\'t always mean anything!   This is one \"forgotten\" film that is best forgotten--it\\'s only a curiosity for cinemaniacs (and VERY hard to find on video, but I\\'ve managed to buy a copy).',\n",
       " b\"This movie really sucked. And I even like Andrew Dice Clay. Some other comments deplored his misogyny, but you have to understand that that is Clay's shtick. Clay was one of a long line of shock comics. Having said all that, this film was awful. The lead-up to the concert was not remotely funny, and the concert itself just wasn't funny (and I know Clay can be funny).\",\n",
       " b\"Derailroaded might be about music, but Wild Man Fischer isn't particularly musical in any conventional sense. More of an outsider artist, or maybe just an exploited freakshow, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and creating during his manic peaks. This is more a study of mental illness than anything else, and we see Fischer beginning to treat the film crew as he has finally treated everyone who has tried to help him in the past. Notable scenes include a re-enactment of an interview between Dr. Demento & Frank Zappa, done with puppets, in which each reveals to the other just how beyond-the-pale crazy Fischer is.\",\n",
       " b\"For the third and final Topper film, Roland Young is now shed of the Kirbys from the two previous films and he and Billie Burke are now starting on a needed vacation with Eddie Anderson as chauffeur and Patsy Kelly as maid. Hey it's the best way to travel.  But the other world isn't finished with him yet. Carole Landis and her friend Joan Blondell are on their way to spend the night with her father, H.B. Warner, at the old family haunted estate. If it wasn't haunted before it sure gets haunted after Blondell is murdered by mistake because the killer is after Landis.  Of course that magnet for the other world Cosmo Topper attracts ghosts like moths to a flame and of course the now other worldly Blondell enlists him to find out who murdered her.   Rounding out this cast of some of the best character actors around are Dennis O'Keefe as a taxi driver trying to collect a fare, Donald MacBride as the perennial dumb cop and George Zucco as the doctor/friend of the Landis/Warner family.   The mystery has plenty of plot holes in it and we're never really told the reason why Landis is being targeted. One thing I will say though, given that the reader of this review might be knowledgeable in the typecasting of all these faces, don't think you've identified the culprit by that.  Roland Young probably could have gone on making more Topper films, but I'm willing to bet he decided to quit while ahead. In any event Cosmo Topper probably decided to go with the flow and left the banking profession to become a psychic.\",\n",
       " b'This is one of the worst movies I\\'ve seen in a long time. I believe everyone involved in its production was cynically motivated by greed and hubris, and possibly large quantities of pharmaceuticals. There was not enough sex in this to elevate it to the level of a \"3\" or \"4\" rating out of 10 possible. Further evidence that centipedes will outlast us.  IMDb requires that I write 10 lines of text. What further commentary could possibly illuminate you as to the childish and silly nature of this movie? Escape now while you have the chance. I like escapism and \"bad\" movies if they have some qualities worthy of redemption. All I can say about this one is that the bad girl whose large boobies dangle in the exercise sequence was sexy in a very dirty way. And then she was gone.  So will we all be. Let this not be the legacy of the human species.',\n",
       " b\"This movie was one of the most surprisingly entertaining movies I have ever seen. The dialogue was just not grossly disengaging, but the gawdy dance choreography couldn't help but make me laugh. This movie reminded me of West Side Story, except as if directed and choreographed by a blind, mentally challenged individual.  The storyline, if you can call it that was so terrible. While watching the movie you know it is so mentally abusing to do so, but like a train wreck, can't help but keep your eyes fixated on its amazement.  Definite must see, if you and your friends want to have a great laugh, or if you are just feeling self-destructive.\",\n",
       " b\"I stayed up to watch this film thinking it was the incredible 1980's Japanese manga movie 'Hokuto no ken'. Little did I know there was a farcical 1990's low budget Hollywood version, and this indeed was it. This is surely the gayest film of all time, particularly in the final battle scene, in which one of the main protagonists is wearing a woman's blouse. It is all bronzed, shiny flesh and rippling muscles and plenty of 'smell the fart' acting. As I recall, the plot of the original version was quite hard to follow, but for this version it seems to have pretty much been given up on altogether. The best thing about this film is that it stars Downtown Julie Brown, who has the coolest name in showbiz.\",\n",
       " b'I really have to ask myself what I expected from a movie that has Ron Pallilio from Welcome Back Kotter as the male lead sex symbol. Not much, I guess and that\\'s exactly what I got! Not much! When I popped the DVD of Hellgate on I realized less than five minutes into it that I had seen this movie over ten years ago. You don\\'t forget acting this bad! So the movie starts with three friends waiting for their fourth friend Matt (Horseshack!) to show up at their vacation spot. They while away the time telling ghost stories. One girl deadpans the tale of The Legend Of Hellgate, which is apparently the next town over. In a flashback we see an attempted rape gone bad that happened in Hellgate in the \\'50s. A bunch of no-good-nick bikers are at the malt shop and they decide to grab the big cheese mayor of Hellgate\\'s daughter Josie and drive away with her. None of the town folk try to stop them. They drive Josie to a secluded area and rip her skirt off and Josie runs around in black underwear, bobby socks and sneakers looking like she should be doing an 80s aerobics video. (I swear they hired Abigail Wolcott to play \"Josie\" because she had nice legs...She even \"strikes poses\" while being carried away and raped! ) Well, her father - who is a dead ringer for Gomez Addams- comes to rescue her and in the process Josie gets iced.  Later on a guy in a mine finds a strange crystal that has the power to reanimate dead things. Here is where the cheesy special effects (\"done by the people who did the effects in Hellraiser and Hellbound \" the box trumpets!) debut as we see a very fake looking bat, a very fake looking fish and a very fake looking turtle spring back to murderous mutant life. (The turtle scene is actually pretty funny). Josie\\'s papa goes to Josie\\'s shrine (even her headstone has breast implants!) and reserrects Josie so she can lure people to the ghost town for him to kill. Why? I don\\'t know why! Josie picks up Horseshack on the side of the road and seduces him. The seduction scene is a laugh riot! the music is insane! And I had never realized what a bad actor Horseshack is until I saw this: Even his sex scenes are unconvincing! And he\\'s a pretty small guy. When he\\'s lying in bed with Josie naked he\\'s so small compared to her that he looks like a doll! Hahaha! Matt meets up with his friends and drags THEM to Hellgate . Why? I don\\'t know. But they go. And of course they run afoul some zombie ghost town people who chase them around and try to kill them. Josie falls in love with Matt for reasons unknown and Matt\\'s girlfriend is not amused.  Will Matt stay with the living dead girl or go home with his plain Jane girlfriend? Or will the zombies and John Astin\\'s doppelganger kill him? Hellgate is a terrible film all the way around with bad acting, bad script, bad special effects, etc. but there was something FUNNY about it that kept me watching so if you like bad movies like I do you might actually find some entertainment in watching HELLGATE. I will watch it again one day just to watch Josie strike strange Vogue-like poses, a dead turtle bite someones face off and to see Horseshack in the raw again. Comic gold all three!   Speaking of bad movies, if you are lucky you will get the two disc set that not only has Hellgate but also has The Pit. The Pit is even funnier than Hellgate, a real laugh riot! So check that one out! Peace!',\n",
       " b'The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit   Erotic,Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.  It is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years. And yet this film doesn\\'t even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.  Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet there\\'s only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you\\'d see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn\\'t have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn\\'t want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.  In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn\\'t have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels \"editing isn\\'t a hard job anyway right?\" The only reason this \"movie\" found it\\'s way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen isn\\'t it. And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.  Oh yes we did laugh at the end, but I\\'m sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................',\n",
       " b'\"Place Vendome\" makes a few strange decisions early on. You would expect a thriller set in the Paris jewel industry to be glamorous and sexy, but Nicole Garcia has other ideas. Instead, she presents the industry as corrupt, jaded and full of downbeat, sleazy people. Deals take place behind closed doors, in cheap hotel rooms, and dimly-lit office suites. Garcia does everything to make this atmosphere suffocating - there are few outdoors scenes initially. When the action shifts briefly to London, there are no establishing shots. The only clue that we\\'re no longer in Paris is that the dialogue switches to English.  This, no doubt, is an attempt to add realism to the milieu. It succeeds, but at the cost of draining the film of interest. Little narrative momentum is created, and the low-key lighting, presumably aimed at creating a noir atmosphere, ends up murky instead.  The main interest lies, predictably enough, with Catherine Deneuve, in yet another mid-life crisis role. Of course, she holds the attention like the old pro she is, but this is itself a problem. We\\'re introduced to various mysterious characters when Deneuve is off-screen, but they seem lifeless and uninteresting by comparison.  And yet, the final half-hour actually works. Much is explained about the characters\\' motivations in a haunting flashback scene, set in an unforgiving wintry landscape. Following on from that the film finally develops some tension. However, this seems to be too little, too late. This is a wasted opportunity.',\n",
       " b\"I am a firm believer in watching an entire movie before you render an opinion. I almost had to break my own rule while watching this atrocity.

       " b'William Lustig\\'s followup to \"Maniac\" proves conclusively that, without Tom Savini\\'s spectacular effects and Spinell\\'s convincing performance, \"Maniac\" would never have become the cult hit that it did. \"Vigilante\" is badly directed, with a simple-minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn, and also mediocre performances by all the actors. Judging from the sense of \"deja vu\" this film gave me, Lustig had watched \"Death Wish\" several times too many before making this! (*1/2)',\n",
       " b\"Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.\",\n",
       " b\"Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man, recently widowed, learning in the last three weeks he is HIV-positive; he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had, brings him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive. Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out. James Marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting--it's like watching a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality-turn from shy guy to kidnapper-on-the-edge isn't convincing, and neither are the conversations the two men have. Marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic, of course--he's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's plight--but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance. The movie isn't a cop-out, exactly, but it is a fraud, handicapped further by the bad editing, the poorly-conceived flashbacks, the low-budget production, and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama. *1/2 from ****\",\n",
       " b'This could have been your run of the mill erotic thriller with the tired plot of lonely couple takes in drifter, drifter has affair with woman, etc. However with superb acting by the entire cast, good writing and direction this goes beyond the genre.

I do not understand the last scene with Alonso, but this is a must see sleeper.',\n",
       " b'I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful! From the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can\\'t extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren\\'t touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a \"plane\" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10.',\n",

Each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale, which is truly a hoot.

       " b'Since this movie wanders randomly all over the place, I thought I\\'d follow suit and offer some random thoughts:   Ever notice how all movie-length cartoons are starting to look the same? All the characters have a handful of human-like expressions that are supposed to make the viewer identify with them, and these expressions are recycled over and over and over from one movie to the next. Watch the eyes, for example; they don\\'t hold in one place, the character will say something and the eyes will go down a little bit, then to the side a little bit. The mouth will open to indicate realization. The eyebrows will raise to indicate hope. The brow will furrow to indicate contemplation. And there\\'s always a smartass female character who won\\'t take no guff from the men in the movie. This is why this movie failed, because it\\'s exactly like every other cartoon movie made over the last fifteen years.  Why on earth should there be male and female robots? Don\\'t think about this too hard.  Robin Williams is becoming increasingly irritating as he ages. In twenty years, his voice can be used to sandblast ships in dry dock. Mork needs to go back to Ork already. PLEASE.  Why all the pop culture references? Because the writers were too lazy/uncreative/unmotivated to write a better script, that\\'s why. Instead of a clever parody of technology, we get references to Britney Spears and 2001 a space odyssey. BFD.  Why doesn\\'t Madame Gasket have access to the most sophisticated robotics in the entire world of robotdom? She should have been able to wipe out Rodney and his friends with a snap of her fingers. Instead, five robots take out hundreds. Doesn\\'t make any sense.  I don\\'t care about the robot\\'s mission, their plight, their suffering. When something breaks, you fix it. So? What\\'s the problem? Ratchet wants to sell upgrades instead of parts. Well doesn\\'t Ratchet need parts too? Hard to understand. Don\\'t think about it too hard.  Why in the world does Rodney \"grow\" from an \"infant\" to an \"adult\"? Don\\'t think about this too hard.  Is there any point to this movie? What did the robots accomplish in the end, the right to have spare parts instead of upgrades? Wouldn\\'t you really rather have an upgrade than the same old parts? Given a choice between the stock part and a superior aftermarket upgrade, anyone would want an upgrade.',\n",
       " b\"A convict serving time comes forward to give the Cold Case unit information about the murder of a policeman, committed years before. The murder of Sean Cooper, a good cop, was never solved. Naturally, the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues.  In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of James Bruno's baby. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is tension as Sean, who is the godfather, arrives disheveled and late for the rite. Eileen Bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there. The real mystery is revealed by her. She caught Sean, who was drinking with Jimmy in the backyard, kiss her husband, and more shocking yet, Jimmy responding willingly.  Somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip. Sean has not endeared himself to his superior because he discovered the involvement with a criminal in his area who controlled the drug business. Sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags Sean and Jimmy haul into the station all the time. The pressure is too much on Jimmy. Sean is comfortable in his homosexuality and wants to be honest about it. Cooper's own father doesn't want anything to do with a queer son. Even his superior McCree wants him out of his jurisdiction, but the case is complicated because Cooper comes from a long line of Irish men serving in the police force. Sean is killed because his homosexual condition, and for knowing too much on his peers' involvement in taking dirty money.  Tom Petit wrote this honest portrayal of the life of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop. We thought it was a frank account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days. Sometimes the people involved with the show, fearing reprisals from sponsors, or the networks, don't dare to present these real situations. Jeannot Szwarc, shows a sensitive approach to this thorny issue, which is dealt without the sensationalism the case might have been shown with a different team.  There is a rare Chad Everett appearance as the older Jimmy Bruno. His take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't get out of hand. Shane Johnson makes an excellent contribution to the show as Sean Cooper. The cast is marvelous and it includes good all around performances from everyone under Mr. Szwarc's direction.  In this episode, Nick Vera, gets closer to his neighbor, the mother of the basketball player the detective took his ball away. Nick is heading for romance with the woman!\",\n",

       " b\"I love the first film. The second - well, as we all know, we don't have John Belushi with us anymore, which is one strike right there. The filmmakers made the good choices of John Goodman and Joe Morton as backup singers. Had they stopped there, the film would have been much better.  Instead, a kid was thrown into the mix. An orphan, of course. Awwww. Elwood Blues is supposed to act as mentor for the kid (Buster), but forgets to return Buster to the orphanage, getting half the cops in the country and several mean orphanage workers on his tail.  Now, the whole point of the first Blues Brothers film is that these guys can't stay out of trouble. The character of Elwood, with or without Brother Jake, is going to get himself in it up to his eyeballs. The whole story about Elwood being chased for kidnapping is ludicrous. Elwood is going to get in trouble for one thing or another. It didn't have to be kidnapping.  Thus, we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song, one that was belted out by three fine singers (Aykroyd, Goodman, and Morton), thus ruining the whole effect. It's no wonder that the Blues Brothers lost the Battle of the Bands - I'd have booed them offstage for bringing a kid into the mix.  There's an cloying, aren't-we-cute gushiness about Buster and his little Blues Brothers outfit that almost gags me. I loved the musical numbers and all the guest artists - and what an impressive group they are! - so I can't understand why the filmmakers would drag down the storyline by introducing a kid, and throwing in all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s associated with a small child interacting with adults. The kid is precocious. He's (supposedly, though I see no evidence of it) a good singer. He gives a pep talk at the crucial time. He's easy to bond with. It just doesn't work.  I will watch it for the music and for Elwood's highly inventive method of parallel parking, but I fast-forward through Buster's scenes.\",\n",
       " b'For all of the hype about this film, I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think. And, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few \"old time\" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is in its climax. The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body. The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma? - was not elucidated upon! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending.',\n",
       " b'Girl Shy is phenomenal. It really has it all. It is a fantastically funny movie about an innocent \"girl shy\" everyman who ends up at the end with the big break and, of course, the beautiful girl. The romance is absolutely breathtaking. The pathos is inspiring--practically had me in tears. The comedy is genuine-indeed, the fantasy sequences are very, very interesting to say the least. The ending chase scene is cinematic genius. Its similarity to the ending of The Graduate is eerie. Released 82 years ago, this film had me on the edge of my seat throughout. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Harold Lloyd is a forgotten Hollywood icon. With the 2005 DVD release of his greatest films (including Girl Shy), that will undoubtedly soon change.',\n",
       " b'***Somewhat of a SPOILER***  I rented this movie with much anticipation. The title alone got me excited about it. I had also seen an interview with one of the stars on Fuse a while back and desired to see it then.  First off...I think \"Manic\" was not the right title for the movie. The main character in the movie, Lyle, shows some signs of mania...but he\\'s more angry and obviously cannot control any sort of anger. It is possible I may be confused by what the title is referring to, however, since this movie is placed in a mental ward and the characters are taking such things as Tegretol and Depakote, I leaned towards the bipolar disorder basis before I even rented the movie.   I did not like the \"token characters.\" They wore thin with \"Girl, Interrupted.\" Let\\'s see....we have the girl that is goth looking (because we all know girls that wear black lipstick are wildly depressed). We have the quiet girl who is always calm towards people, but has obvious problems and is always holding things back. We have the person that makes everyone angry because he is so mad about his own life, he must make things terrible for all the people there. We have the friend that there is no hope for, because he does not try to get better (I feel mostly because he does not know how to live outside of a hospital). We have the shy one with lots of problems and who stays mostly quiet until the main character can bring some sort of feeling out of him. And last, but certainly not least, the main character...the one that comes in thinking they have no problem, but in the end realizes and works to get better and tries and usually ends up making an impact on some of the people there. I think maybe I should label this with a spoilers...but it is so typical.  The jerky camera work throughout the movie gets really, really annoying. It\\'s like the director is screaming, \"THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!\" The opening scene is done in an interesting fashion, that\\'s about all I liked about it. I will, however, give credit for some decent performances. They were well calculated, but too similar to other movies dealing with mental illness issues.   2/4 stars',\n",
       " b\"Documentary is all about taking real life and shaping it into a story. 'Forgotten Silver' suggests that real part doesn't even have to be real, as long as the story's good.  I watched this again tonight - probably the 4th or 5th time I've seen it since it was first screened as an (allegedly) true doco back in 1996. Despite knowing the whole thing was cod, I was quite surprised to find tears in my eyes as NZ pioneer film-maker Colin McKenzie accidentally filmed his own death in Spain, so drawn was I into the story.  Once you strip away the hype over the hoax factor, what's left is just a great story about a struggling film maker facing and almost overcoming insurmountable obstacles to create a work of mad genius. Anyone expecting belly laughs from 'Forgotten Silver' is probably going to be disappointed, because viewed as a story, this isn't a comedy - it's a tragedy. It's no wonder so many people were sucked into believing it when it first screened - the Colin McKenzie saga has an emotional depth which is heartbreaking.  Bonus points for a brilliant musical score, some superb technical effects (especially the corroded, bubbling, self-destructing nitrate film; most filmmakers would have settled for a couple of clich\\xc3\\xa9 tramlines to make the footage look old), and the gorgeous Thomas Robbins as Colin McKenzie.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie looks great but there isn't anything worthwhile happening to sustain the viewer's interest for more than five minutes.  It joins THX-1138, Alien 3, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien Nation, and The Coneheads on the list of sci-fi pictures with bald women in the cast, not very original. Having the characters bald to represent dehumanization is a stale idea whose time has past.  The whole movie is as cold as outer space. Nobody in the film generates anything resembling sympathy. The whole thing is so uninteresting that I really didn't care who the stranger (in a strange land) was or how he got his mysterious powers.  It's a real shame because the special effects were great, with the exception of the shots of the microscopic robots traveling through the bloodstream. They looked like they were done on a personal computer.  The attempts by the director to show off were as pretentious as the movie was on a whole.\",\n",
       " b'It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because I\\'m a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so I\\'ll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith\\'s character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.  Our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. Smith\\'s Thomas has lists of names, one of people we don\\'t know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. Working with the IRS allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give them\\xc2\\x97a gift that could completely alter their circumstances. He calls an old childhood friend (Barry Pepper) and reminds him to do what it is he promised, to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. Even in a role as small as Pepper\\'s, you can\\'t help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background, hanging above everyone\\'s head. It is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. His breakdowns, whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions, show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.  After that phone call, begins the journey to meet new people. Thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk, trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. This progression takes many turns, from a \"blind, vegan, meat salesman\" that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient, unable to print her line of stationary, or even run with her Great Dane Duke; to an abused and scared Latino mother of two, too afraid to leave her boyfriend; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. There are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day, and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. Why it is up to Thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his \"gift\" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the IRS. As he says, though, \"he kind of stumbled into the job\".  Smith\\'s quest as Thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. As a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. If that means he must yell and make fun of them, he must do it. At every step, though, you see the suffering in his eyes, the pain eating away at his soul, taking each step towards his fate, one as a saint of redemption, not only for those he wants to help, but for himself as well. It is an award-worthy performance and I only wish Smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles, because, while they are fun, this guy is too good for them. The man better win an Oscar before he is done or it will be a travesty\\xc2\\x97at least in my mind.  The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. His shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. Elpidia Carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. And Rosario Dawson shines as the \"once hot\" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It is the introduction of Smith\\'s Thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.',\n",
       " b\"This TV-series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid. Even though I see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, I can still tell it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember.  The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, school still hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show. It also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise, with nice examples within the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you? :D The cartoon looked nice, very kids friendly of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electric signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body.  This, and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale) were key parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.\",\n",
       " b\"I've watched several episodes of Jeff Ltd., because it can take time for a new series to find its rhythm. Honestly, though, this show started out bad and just got worse.   On the plus side, the look of the show is very slick and professional, but that's not necessarily an asset to comedy anyway. But overall, the characters are dull, passionless, and the tone is too cool and cynical to let any of its lowbrow humour work. It's very hard to imagine a group of TV professionals sitting in a room watching this show and saying, yep, that's funny, that works. Because it really, really doesn't.\",\n",
       " b'Though lacking in character development, Tom Clancy novels are superb for their plot intricacies and fervent attention to detail. The Hunt for Red October -- the best film adaptation of the Jack Ryan series thus far -- still stands as my favorite film of all time.  Like any writer sensing opportunity, Clancy decided to franchise his name to such series as Op Center and Net Force. Op Center was actually a surprisingly \"OK\" TV mini-series, thanks to the efforts of Harry Hamlin and Lindsay Frost. Net Force, however, is a total disaster.  It\\'s difficult even to establish blame. While the notion of an Internet investigations division of the FBI sounds appealing (isn\\'t the Secret Service in fact charged with this responsibility?), everything in Op Center is ludicrous. The sophomoric romantic storyline of Bakula and Going, the uber Bill Gates villain played by Judge Reinhold, and the Kris Kristofferson (Can you believe he was in fact a Rhodes Scholar and former Army pilot??) dead mentor with a secret -- all of this just defies conventional wisdom or reality.  Without belaboring the point, Net Force is just plain not entertaining.',\n",
       " b\"THE FOX AND THE CHILD is the latest film from MARCH OF THE PENGUINS filmmaker Frenchman Luc Jacquet. The movie, which boasts just one human being in its cast, young actress Bertille No\\xc3\\xabl-Bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare, though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.  Part-nature documentary, and part-fairy tale, the film focuses on L'Infant, the child, who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting, possibly France, though the exact location is never mentioned. Over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox, who she begins to call Lily, once again. And so it goes on. Days turn to weeks, and then the summer disappears, turning to fall and then winter, promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping, white winter landscape. Eventually, spring comes around again, and the young child finds her fox, and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal. And so on.  I had little to no expectation for THE FOX AND THE CHILD. I had seen MARCH OF THE PENGUINS and was simply in awe at the film-making contained in that movie. Luc Jacquet is a hugely talented, and indeed rare film-maker, and I was expecting some superb, breathtaking cinematography, sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife. This was delivered in spades. But here Jacquet has a screen writing credit, and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening, I expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'March'. A fictional story.  The child and the fox And the story is simple. A young, seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school, seemingly on her own, every day, seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world. Without the hint of an adult in sight. Brilliant. So she strikes up a friendship with a fox.  With a film like this, you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience. This is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of, I'd say, six and up. Or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet Sunday afternoon. Not a 31-year-old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent, brilliant WANTED and the like. But, me being the newbie London critic, I put myself in the shoes of an excited eight-year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of THE FOX AND THE CHILD. Now, I have a few problems with this film. As a 31-year-old lad, and loyal lover of all things cinematic, I loved the wildlife and landscape photography. It's visually stunning. The direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed -- as good as you will find on any of Attenborough's efforts. As an impressionable, short attention spanning eight year old, I loved about the first half hour -- then I lost interest. It's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child, particularly the rather dark ending. As a 31-year-old male -- I was a little frightened in places. Wuss.  So, it's not a child's film. It's not really an adult film and I felt a little let down. Is it a good family film. Depends. It's educational maybe, and the film carries a message. It's definitely not a film I would pay the hard earned green to go see and I'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer. It's hard, but I know some will go see and fall in love this film. It's very European in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks, give it a try. Unsure? Well I'd wait for the DVD for a wet Sunday afternoon in then. -- Paul Heath, http://www.thehollywoodnews.com, July 2008.\",\n",
       " b'I could barely get through this racist piece of crap. Let\\'s see. Here\\'s a poorly made film that abruptly stops to splash \"facts\" on the screen that are either half-truths or just outright falsehoods. What\\'s so ironic is that the entire thrust of this film is designed to illustrate the importance of Latinos in California. Instead, it simply perpetuates the hideous stereotype that whites are privileged racists and that all Latinos are saints.  Above and beyond all that, it\\'s boring as hell. If you want propaganda go watch something like \"Triumph of the Will\". At least Leni Riefenstahl could operate a camera. As for this, don\\'t waste your time.  Oh, and for the record, I\\'ve seen white people work in fields, wash dishes and operate vacuum cleaners. They\\'ve been doing it in the south for eons.',\n",
       " b'Over the last ten years, Burt Reynolds has straddled the line between being an A-lister and a B-lister. His best known comeback was in 1997, when he re-emerged into the A-list spotlight with \"Boogie Nights\". Ten years later, he was still making good movies along the likes of \"Mystery, Alaska\" and the decent remake of \"The Longest Yard\". If he keeps doing movies like \"Cloud 9\", he may have to kiss those A-list parts goodbye again.  The problem with \"Cloud 9\" is not that Burt Reynolds is bad in it. In fact, the movie starts out really well with Reynolds playing a lovable loser. It\\'s not the first time he plays one of these characters, and he usually plays it very well. It\\'s just that the movie is boggled down with so many sports and rags-to-riches movie clich\\xc3\\xa9s that by the end, the movie seems far from original even though the premise is.  The premise is another great thing about this movie, and the movie had the right idea about where to go with it until the very end. The problems occur with the lack of character development. Burt Reynolds\\' and D.L. Hughley\\'s characters are pretty well developed, but the strippers could have been made into more interesting characters. Instead, they are just one-dimensional stereotypes borrowed from other movies. There\\'s the jive-talking black woman, the blond stripper with a heart of gold, the angry Latino stripper, and the Russian bombshell that no speak English good. Oh yeah, and although Angie Everheart does a better-than-expected acting job in this movie, her character has been done before. If I had a nickel for every movie where there was a smart, single mother who was forced to strip to support their only child, I\\'d be a millionaire. In fact, wasn\\'t Burt Reynolds himself in a big budget film with one of those characters? The name \"Striptease\" rings a bell, as does the name \"Demi Moore\". And as I remember, that movie didn\\'t get stellar reviews either.  Last but not least, Gabrielle Reese could have been utilized better in this movie. Sure, she\\'s a natural fit for playing a professional volleyball athlete, since she is one in real life. But the problem comes when she expresses her objection to strippers playing volleyball, since that would bring the wrong kind of exposure to the sport. Of course she is correct and has a valid point, but the movie unevenly makes her out to be the villain of the story because of that viewpoint. Plus, the guys in the movie make fun of the fact that she\\'s built like an athlete, which doesn\\'t send a good message to young women who see this movie. They appear to completely forget the fact that Gaby Reese is one of the most beautiful women in the world, let alone the most gorgeous athlete. In fact, I found myself rooting for her side at the end of the film, and really not caring either way if the heroines won.  This movie was very promising. In fact, the movie started out great, and even Paul Rodriguez was funny as Juan a.k.a. Wong. However, the really important characters in this story were underdeveloped, and so many movie clich\\xc3\\xa9s, tired archetypes, and male posturing made this movie unenjoyable. I reiterate when I say that Burt Reynolds should probably get a new agent, because he has been in and can be in better movies.',\n",

Captain Blackadder is simply trying has best to get out of this silly war with the Germans. But the idiot, General Melchett, keeps him there.

You can\\'t help but wonder how movies like this ever get made? I mean, who would read a script like this and say \"hey, this is great, let\\'s make it\" or \"hey, this is great, I\\'d like to audition for this movie\".

       " b'You can\\'t deny that Wes Craven\\'s original \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" was horror of great significance and, although dreadfully overrated, it was a pretty clever and spooky film that introduced the legendary icon of Freddy Krueger. It was obvious right from the start that none of the several sequels would ever live up to the original and this first attempt immediately confirms so. Despite a dazzling intro, showing a school bus racing through a nightmarish wasteland with Freddy at the wheel, this is a very tame and soft teenage-horror flick, completely lacking coherence and logic. The story supposedly takes place 5 years after the initial Elm Street events and the house where Nancy lived has been sold to the Walsh family. The adolescent son Jesse begins to suffer from nightmares in which Freddy Krueger orders him to kill in his shape. The screenplay is a series of stupidities and continuity errors but the whole things basically is an excuse to show fairly impressive visual effects, so who cares about the story anyways? Jesse\\'s transformations into Freddy Krueger are well staged and the murders he commits are decently gore. Several sequences and scenery don\\'t make the slightest bit of sense (exploding parakeets, guard dogs with children\\'s faces\\xc2\\x85) and the suspense-elements of the original have vanished entirely. The acting is considerably good, even though the hero screams like a little girl and the heroine looks like Meryl Streep\\'s younger sister. At least in this first sequel, Robert Englund doesn\\'t constantly fire off unfunny and embarrassing one-liners.',\n",
       " b'I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.  I watched several documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors \\xc2\\x96 never!  He can\\'t direct nor write. His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word \"art\" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.  Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS HE KIDDING?  He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising. Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.  Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can, then I might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them.',\n",

       " b'Let me first say that after watching the pilot I agreed with the first poster; the show was awful, and I was ready to call it quits and free up space on my DVR. However (and fortunately for me), my parents enforced a Three Bite Rule at dinner when I was growing up; I adapted this into the \"Three Show Rule\" and sat down to the next two episodes of \"Flash\" with a virtuous, if heavy heart. The good news is that things got better.  The show is still not great, but I gave it an 8/10 because it is now doing a good job at being exactly what it should be, a campy romp with clever dialog and just plain fun. We sit down to this show now with pleasure, and even choose it first over other shows like \"Heroes\" when we want something guaranteed to be light and fun. The acting has gotten better, but it\\'s the writing that\\'s really improved. It\\'s as if the writers, having made it through the obligatory story setup and character introductions, are finally able to have fun with their work. And now, I am too.',\n",
       " b\"What an utterly incompetent piece of absolute garbage, can someone please tell me how movies like this get made? On my Episode 1 rating (You know how bad Episode 1 is? Well I now rate movies as to how long they take me to get restless, bored and angry as that George Lucas trash did) this rates a 7. That's 7 minutes it took me to realise I was watching a stinker; even Rancid Aluminium scored a 10!  The plot, such as it is, is that a group of teens decide to have some fun with a ouija board but inadvertently raise an evil Djinn, who then sets about killing them all in gruesome ways. So OK, we're in comfortable teen horror movie territory here, but wait, there's been so many of these movies recently, we need to find a new spin on it, right? So what can we do? I know, great idea, let's just do the same old crap, but let's make it British! Yep, instead of annoying American high-school kids getting gutted instead we get annoying Brits. And that's it. Acting is appalling, direction sub-standard, writing woeful, even the production values are on the shoddy side. At least the 'enjoyment' in these movies is seeing people murdered in gory ways, but here the killings happen off screen. And every bad horror-movie clich\\xc3\\xa9 is relentlessly churned out, then used again for good measure, and again, and again.  Example, the old staple of young guy (let's call him Chad), unwisely exploring shadowy lit basement hears loud thump, so nervously calls out name of his buddy, `Chris? Chris, is that you? Hey man, quit screwing around!' But Chris doesn't reply. So, tentatively, Chad walks down the corridor, slowly at first, then building up a little as he nears the door. And as the sweat breaks out on his revered brow and he strains to hear every sound, he tentatively reaches out an outstretched hand to the door knob, yanking it open in terrified despair only for Chris to jump out at him and shout `Got you Chad!'  Yahhhhh!  How many times have we seen this fake tension builder before, I ask you? Well obviously not enough, because director Marcus Adams uses it five times in this movie; I know, because I counted! I mean, what gives? Does Marcus Adams want to be the next Danny Cannon? They even had a spooky old man, straight out of Scooby Doo, who pops up at appropriate times saying things like, `You kids don't know what you're dealing with here!' And this took four people to write?!  Ahh! I refuse to write any more and waste my time on such junk.  THE HORROR!\",\n",

And then there\\'s Andy Warhol\\'s Dracula. This one tops the rest as far as how BAD a movie can be. Some have called it original, creative, even a \"loose\" adaptation of Bram Stoker\\'s masterpiece. I\\'m here to tell you that these descriptions are NOT the case.  This work is pure garbage!

This is because most people cannot guess what will happen because the movie is ingeniously clever. The action sequences are very well handled. Many people say that they got very bored watching the explosion again and again , but i found this interesting as each time you see it from a different view point and each time it gives something else away and leaves you on a cliffhanger, wondering what will happen next.

McBain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all of the classic elements of a late 80\\'s/early 90\\'s action film....the random gratuitous acts of violence (ie. when Walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money), the snapping of necks, the guys on fire, the guys that get blown off buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings. Walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as, \"let\\'s go sit..........out on the deck.\" and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store. if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.',\n",
       " b'In Afghanistan, during the Taliban regime, women are forbidden to work and to walk on the streets without the company of a male. The teenager girl Osama (Marina Golbahari) cuts her hair and dresses like a boy to get a job and support her widow mother and grandmother. There is no men in her family, since her father and her brother were killed in previous Afghan wars, and the family has no means of survival. When Osama, disguised as a boy, is called by the Taliban to join the school and military training, the boy Espandi (Arif Herati) tries to help her.  \"Osama\" is a spectacular film, based on true events, and the interpretation of the amateurish cast is so perfect that sometimes the movie looks like a documentary. It is amazing how different from Western cultures is the life, religion, streets, houses of the Afghan people, and how repressed the women are in this evil system. Although being aware of many atrocities of this fanatical power, through articles in newspapers and magazines, this movie is so real and impressive that makes the viewer feel in the skin the difficulties of the life of this poor people. This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban. In accordance with the interview of the director Siddiq Barmak in the Extras of the DVD, Marina Golbahari was accidentally discovered four days before the beginning of the shootings. The girls had never watched a movie in a theater, and did not have a TV. Two days before the beginning of the shootings, Barmak met Arif Herati, and decided to create a special character for him, not foreseen in the original screenplay. The boy requested the director to buy his dogs to accept the invitation. This movie was awarded many international prizes, among them the Golden Globe (Best Movie),Golden Camera (Cannes Festival) and Best Movie (London Festival), and certainly deserves to be among the IMDb Top 250. My vote is ten.  Title (Brazil): \"Osama\"',\n",

They actually showed reruns of it back when I was in grammar school, and I never forgot it. Well,according to Amazon.com, \"Tenspeed and Brownshoe: The Complete Series\" will be released on DVD in March of this year! I\\'m ordering my copy ahead of the release date so I suggest you guys check it out. At the price they\\'re offering I doubt there\\'ll be any extras but that\\'s fine with me. It\\'s true that the chemistry between Jeff Goldblum and Ben Vereen was easy and natural. Because the actors liked each other, their character\\'s friendship seemed genuine. They were so mismatched and from totally different backgrounds, and yet they worked so well together. I was such a sucker for private eye novels and TV shows, and I loved how Stephen J. Cannell played with that genre\\'s conventions on this show in particular. Neither of them had law- enforcement backgrounds; one of them had been on the wrong side of the law most of his life and the other one was as straight-laced as could be. Yet they were legitimate private eyes, combining their unique talents to solve the mystery while making us smile along the way. I loved how they went back and forth with each other; nowadays, this type of banter is par for the course, but in 1980 it was so ahead of it\\'s time. Anyway, just wanted to let my fellow fans know the news.Thanks!',\n",

Assuming this is true, he should know better than this. I understand this is a chick-flick but to appeal to the male audience there needs to be some accuracy here. This movie is definitely not BULL DURHAM. PITCHER AND THE PINUP falls flat. Everything with baseball in this movie made me laugh. The sports clich\\xc3\\xa9s, stadium inaccuracies, and actors who don\\'t look like ball-players make thishilarious. Among the the absurd highlights: -- \"But coach, (I can\\'t play third) I\\'ve pitched EVERY GAME this year!\" -- The gypsy/scout who foretells the future with his deck of cards. -- The can\\'t miss Major Leaguer who can\\'t hit balls thrown at a speed meant for a 4-yr-old with a giant plastic red bat until he learns a poem to help him with his hitting. -- The star going AWOL for two weeks and being allowed back by a sympathetic manager because of a \"woman.\" -- The best friend being offered a contract and a spot on the team after the manager sees him playing catch. No hitting, No workout, No interview. Just catch. -- \"Congratulations on your 15 strikeouts and your 4 for 4 with a home run.\"   Basically, this movie is absurd, yet hilarious. You will only like this movie of you are female. If you are a real guy you will fine this funny.  My other gripes: -- Borrowed love story of Forrest Gump -- Why in the world was she always saying \"I love this country?\" Was she an immigrant? I guess so because she grew up in Vegas. -- Flashback overload. Enough of the Star Wars and Farrah Fawcett Tshirts. Also, if you use historical events to timeframe, use something astronomical, not the obscure highjacking of a cruise ship. My favorite timeframe placing was when one character goes, \"Man, it is 1988!\"   In the end, this movie HILARIOUS. Cheesy lines, bad casting, horrible acting, and inaccuracies ...

The script is threadbare, and Landis relies heavily on hammy gags and scenery-chewing.

They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. I can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess. Look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, the widows, Windy Poplars . . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake!!! Wouldn't it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! But L.M. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. This movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough Anne of Green Gables to life.\",\n",

You may ask?...well obviously it wouldn't be much of a drama if they just found it and put it in a maritime museum :p)   Anyway after the recent hype about the drama I did have high expectations but was disappointed. There was lots of submarine jargon which went over my head, so unless you have a particular history with or an interest in submarines, then I'm assuming most people would have the same problem... and so it got a little confusing.  I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined?   Now I know there were some grey areas as to which was going on in the past and which was in the present but Hardy did state that it was only 1943 inside of the sub and still very much 1981 outside... hence the reason why the Russians of 1981 were getting a little anxious at the sight of the sub on its radar... so I'm assuming that the boats they blew up were real and of 1981 too?   But...if I did get too confused by all the submarine jargon...and completely missed something due to this fact...and anyone knows any different...please tell me?   Thanks :-)\",\n",
       " b'Well, what do you know? After mentioning this film in a completely different review, it pops up on the BBC less than a day later. Which gives me an excellent chance to watch this film one more time and judge it on merit and not memory.  This time, Axel Foley (Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills to investigate the attempt on the life of an old friend and the connection with the so-called Alphabet Murders. Teaming up with his colleagues from the first film, Axel goes \"deep undercover\" to bring the perps to justice though not without indulging the viewer with a glorified view of Eighties California. You know, sports cars and palm trees. Rich bitches and their poodles, that sort of thing.  The reason I mentioned \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" in my review was that, for me, it\\'s one of those films that you know inside out and still enjoy watching it despite the fact that it isn\\'t the best example of the genre. Cop movies are 10 for a dollar but this one always sticks in my mind. Watching it last night reminded me of an extended edition of \"Miami Vice\" with its sharp suits, fast cars and faster women. Even one of the characters refers to \"six foot blonde women growing on trees\" in Beverly Hills. All the Eighties references were there - the scene at Playboy Mansion, the angry police chief (this film had two), the hyperactive stockbroker and, of course, Eddie Murphy. When will someone tell him that his era ended when the Eighties did? I fail to see how a foul-mouthed comedian and actor like Murphy can go from films like this to the awful \"Daddy Day Care\". Interesting to see the man who filled his shoes in the Nineties, Chris Rock from \"Rush Hour\", in a small cameo. Made me smile, anyway.  But for all it\\'s faults, I still enjoy watching this film. At the time, it might have been cutting edge but now, it\\'s more of a documentary. Simpson and Bruckheimer productions are all more-or-less identical but this has the added bonus of baring witness to an Eighties gloss overdose. Throughout this film, I kept getting reminded of that fantastic game \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and if you liked that, you\\'ll enjoy this. Basically, if you can handle the bright neon and the famous synthersizer intro, you\\'ll love it. But if you\\'re still trying to blank the memory of Thatcher, Reagan and (more horrifically) The Human League, steer well clear.',\n",

The Fairy Godmother is there as well, and carelessly flings her wand in the bushes while singing. The wand lands in the hands of Anastasia, one of Cinderella\\'s stepsisters. And soon, the wicked stepmother takes matters into her own hands by reversing time to when the duke arrived to try the slipper on the feet of the stepsisters. BUT, this time- the wand is used to make it fit Anastaia\\'s foot. From there, a suspenseful series of events follow Cinderella as she tries to set things right.  This film is amazing. It is the best Disney sequel I\\'ve seen to date. The animation isn\\'t the quality of a theatrical release, but it much better than most direct-to-video films are.  The story is very suspenseful and creative. It is slightly predictable, but aside from that, it keeps your attention and not once will you be bored.  The acting is wonderful. The voices are obviously not that of the original film, but the actors do their best to bring feeling to the characters, and that is what matters. (In my opinion, the actress who voices Anastasia did a wonderful job.) The film contains some new songs. No song is as great as anything you\\'d find in a golden Disney film, but again- these songs are ones you want to listen to again. Along with the songs, the score to the film is wonderful especially in climactic scenes. And yes- there are \"action\" scenes in this film, and they are wonderful.  This film wasn\\'t made for money. It was made to please all the fans who were disappointed in \"Cinderella 2.\" And let me tell you, Disney did something right with a sequel for once.',\n",

It is still the essence of Flynn\\'s screen personna, and it still brings joy to his fans. The only drawback here: Viveca Linfors is no Olivia deHavilland. Chemistry is sadly missing, but this is nit-picking. It is sumptuous on every level, and when a first-time viewer sees that staircase, a \"WOW!\" is to be be expected. Robert Douglas seemed to make a career of playing heavies, and in this film, he raises villainy to an art form.

I enjoyed the slow build up to the climax of the film; Puri in one of his best \"bad guy\" roles was also great.   .. One warning, I had to buy this DVD three times.

I would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until I and a few friends spent (and I mean \"spent\" in the sense of \"exhausted\", \"used up\", \"wasted\") an evening watching \"The Wizard of Gore\". Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects. Then, one of my friends watching pointed out just how dull the bits in between the gore scene were. Quite true. Even the lead-ins to the supposed shock scenes crept along at a snail\\'s pace, completely dissipating any tension there might have been. It is almost impossible for anyone to pay attention to this film because for most of the film, nothing happens. Then, when the gore scenes come, you haven\\'t been engaged by the film in any way. You really just don\\'t care about what happens next. The Lewis cult people should give it up. Lewis is incompetent as a director and his movies are not innovative - just dull, repulsive little cinematic abortions.',\n",
       " b'Amar, Akbar and Anthony are separated from their family and from each other as small children, and each is raised separately and in a different faith. Amar is raised a Hindu and grows up to become a police officer, Akbar is raised a Muslim and grows up to become a Qawaali singer whilst Anthony is raised Christian and grows up to be a small time hoodlum.  Most of the movie is focussed on the character of Anthony, which is fine by me since he is played by Amitabh Bachchan - surely the most charismatic actor India has ever produced.  As adults, none of the brothers have any idea of their familial origins, but believe their parents to be dead. To make matters worse, each parent thinks the other is dead and both think their children are dead. It must be said that they didn\\'t go to great lengths to discover this, but the film would hardly have worked if they had so that\\'s one piece of disbelief that has to be suspended. It\\'s not the last one, as the film is wholly guided by a series of coincidences that gradually has the various members of the family crossing each others paths. I suppose one is encouraged to believe that these coincidences are orchestrated by the fates or a higher power, but putting it down to dramatic convenience worked just as well for me.  Also brought into the plot are the loves of the three brothers, for the requisite romance and feminine wisdom. The boys are lucky enough to have secured the affections of a bevy of beauties, and the actresses add a nice touch of glamour and colour to the film. In addition to and intersecting with these we have the evil villain of the piece, carrying the terribly intimidating name of \"Robert\".  At 175 minutes, Amar Akbar Anthony has plenty of time to flesh out its characters and develop the plot in a well paced fashion. The movie goes through many different moods and emotions, but after the first 15 minutes of melodrama the tone is generally kept light and pleasant.  As well as the romance and drama, the movie has a few moments where it shifts into action territory - Anthony especially has a knack for getting into a scuffle. The fights are very imaginatively choreographed but terribly executed, looking very staged and faked. This all adds to the fun of them though. There\\'s also the songs of course, though not too many - especially in the first half of the film. Some of these are very catchy and the dance choreography cheerfully engaging.  Although it has something of an ensemble cast, there is no question that the movie belongs to Amitabh. His character is the most complicated and interesting, and his performance the most subtle and engaging. He gets all the best lines, too. He won the \"best actor\" award for this role, and it is largely for his performance that the movie is considered an Indian classic.  Like many Indian movies that run in the three hour range, there\\'s something in AAA for everybody, and Amitabh\\'s charisma especially means that it never grows wearisome. Although the first half an hour didn\\'t have me terribly engaged, the film does just keep getting better and better (and more imaginative) as it progresses. I had to constantly keep upgrading my rating for the film as I watched. By the time the movie reaches its climax, it has managed to weave everything together so well that I was thoroughly delighted to be watching it.  Recommended!',\n",
       " b'My German teacher got this from a former student who is living in German and we watched it in class (with the help of some cunning planning and working) and it was the most entertaining 93 minutes I have had in that class (and trust me, entertaining things happen in that class daily) My teacher, who commonly finds humor as the such in the movie (black eye - black guy (translated), Tupperware container for glass coffin and the like)hilarious. He was on the floor laughing. (well not literally, but oh well) There wasn\\'t a dull moment in this movie..from the flash of \"that night\" to the man dwarf singing with a women\\'s voice.

       " b'This movie should not be compared to \"The Sting\", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It\\'s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended!',\n",
       " b\"...may seem like an overstatement, but it is not.  What is so hard to comprehend is - why didn't they make more musical shorts like this? Wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved? I guess not. So many shorts were made for commercial reasons only, and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there. This is one exception - the only one? - where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art. Why didn't anybody ever think to shoot Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy, man.  A pity there were no sequels. If you've seen anything of similar quality please share it!\",\n",

The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways.  The cast are also fantasic..... a great selection of the finest British talent around. I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film.  Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this, - everything about this film works.   I love it :)',\n",

There is loads of political statement made which should make everyone think even if u don't share the opinion. I mean, how many movies are there which talk about politics at all? The movie is full of emotions acted pretty well. The camera which makes u feel to be very close to the scenes and the music support these emotions successfully.   Even if you are not that kind of anarchist, there are still some scenes which are just so familiar to yourself. It's a movie about youth itself I suppose.  The movie is a must-see\",\n",
       " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.  He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.  This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty strong, compelling film, unflinching and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the solidest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on. ***\",\n",

I\\'ve just seen the movie, for the third time, on TV past midnight yesterday and I couldn\\'t close my eyes. Why ? Because Van Dormael knows how to tell a story. Also, you become very attached to all the character, bad and good one.  The cinematography give you the impression that you are dreaming. The camera is so light and the colors are so bright so you know that the imagination of Thomas, the \"Toto\" from the title, is working very hard to remember exactly what happened in his childhood.  If you love a good story with a very interesting plot, this is the one.',\n",
       " b\"Finally after watching Marauding Mothers, Diabolical Daddies, Wicked Sisters, Jonesin' Uncles and Perverted Twins, I arrived at Rabid Grannies. It didn't totally live up to the hype as being 10 times the movie Diabolical Daddies is but it was still pretty good.  Ya got the two grannies, who are actually aunties, who are filthy rich and throwing a birthday party for themselves, with the rest of their immediate family celebrating it with them. Well all seems to be going just divine until a weird lady with a gift shows up. The gift is actually from.....I forget the guy's relation....maybe cousin. Whatever. Well, this present holds a hideous surprise that turns this lil box-social into a full on bloodbath. Woohoo!   Rabid Grannies is a wacky friggin flick. It's got a really silly (too much sometimes) attitude and loads of fantastic make-up and gore effects that combine together to make a seriously memorable flick which should be mentioned more in hor/com discussion.  Most surprisingly about the flick, is it's creativity. There are some creepy scenes mixed with a sly almost cartoony humor that gels in a pretty unique way. There's one scene with the aunts (grannies) and a priest that is really just out there. One aunt is giving him the opportunity to off himself, while the other is telling him to fight for his life. It's really just a cool friggin scene that really had me smiling.  Even though the dialog is sometimes overly hammy, and the dubbing kinda crappy, it kinda makes the movie's ridiculous charm that much more noticeable. Which could be a good thing or bad thing, but for this guy's taste for crazy sh!t, it's a great thing. Would go nice as a double feature with Demon Knight.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie kind of reminds me of A Mary-Kate and Ashley movie-only worse.

The story line wasn't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better. i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I didn't)\",\n",
       " b'The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like \"the real thing\" (Think about it: would we really want to see the real thing?), but it was black and white in a color world, and a lot of people didn\\'t even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. Plus, if you remake it, you can show some stuff not shown in the original. The book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first \"nonfiction novel\". Truman\\'s book was in fact not 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location sufficed for Kansas pretty much for a TV movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock \\'n\\' roll: Dick\\'s womanizing, Perry being an aspirin junkie, Perry playing blues guitar.',\n",
       " b'Title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed   Director: Brett Sullivan   Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson   Tagline: It only dies if you do   Review: After having enjoyed the first Ginger Snaps immensely I decided to check out the sequel which had the same to actresses who played sisters on the last film. Did it live up to the coolness of the original? Well no, to be honest.  The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf. She uses a drug to help slow down the process, but how long will it last? Not a lot of time passes until she ends up in a rehab center and befriends a bunch of messed up junkie girls. The authorities believe that Bridgette is just a junkie in need of some serious rehabilitation. The girls she meets in the center are similar to the group of screwed up kids seen in Nightmare on Elm Street III: The Dream Warriors.  What I liked about the movie was its look. It was well shot and had some stylish camera angles...also some of the characters were very very likable. Like for example the little girl who plays \"ghost\" she was an interesting character and one of the coolest things about the movie. She quickly befriends Bridgette due to the fact that she doest have many friends. I liked her right of the bat just cause she reads and constantly quotes her horror comics. The character of Ghost is the only thing original that this movie has to offer, aside from her and the sub plot with her grandmother, there\\'s nothing new in Ginger Snaps 2.  The problem with the movie is that for the longest time it just draaaags. The whole movie is just about one thing. Teasing you. You keep thinking that eventually your going to see Bridgette transform. Many times through out the film she is found in exactly the same situation...just seconds away from transforming...but then she takes that drug and everything goes back to normal. Its like watching an episode of the Hulk in which Bruce Banner never transforms into the hulking beast. For a long time...nothing really happens. The movie just stretches to the point of boredom. Until the last 15 minutes of course.  This is supposed to be a werewolf movie, yet there\\'s hardly any werewolf action. We only get to see one werewolf and hes hidden in shadows and quick cuts. I wished we could have seen more of the creature we came to see. Could it be that the director is afraid of showing his low budget creature? Hmm..at leas the first one showed the werewolf even if it wasn\\'t the best looking one, it was there.  Sadly we only get to see katherine Isabelle in a small cameo, she was a huge part in what made the first one so much fun, here shes just a watcher, a character who really does nothing except comment on what she sees and torments Bridgette. The chemistry between the two sisters which was in a large part what made the first one so enjoyable is completely gone! That sucked big time for me.  In conclusion this movie had some good characters, a monster that wouldn\\'t show and some nice camera shots. Gone is the chemistry between Bridgette and Ginger and the punch that the first movie had. I don\\'t get whey there\\'s so many positive reviews for this film it was alright, but sadly not as good as the first.  Rating: 21/2 out of 5',\n",
       " b\"This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best known movies but it isn't his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this movie is a take off on Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, turns down an offer, Dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him. After this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a pretty good movie but isn't one of De Palma's best.\",\n",
       " b'I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster. I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family.  I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions.  The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults, has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create.  I found the film to be delightful!',\n",
       " b'This is the sort of film that only Woody Allen (in the 70\\'s) could do. It is all surprisingly classy for a sex comedy, and has many brilliant sketches. There is one part of the film where Gene Wilder plays a doctor who falls in love with a sheep that has to be seen to believed.  Certain parts of the film might be considered to be in extremely bad taste. Case in point is the TV show, \"What\\'s Your Perversion?\", where a Rabbi has a fantasy to be tied up in silk, get whipped, and have his wife kneel at his feet eating pork. All at the same time! Not to say the film isn\\'t funny. In fact, it\\'s one of the funniest I\\'ve seen in a long time. Of course, the best part of the film is the well-known \"What Happens During Ejaculation?\" sketch, where we get to see the inner workings of a man\\'s body during intercourse.  Throughout the course of the film there are many great supporting roles, such as John Carradine as a Frankenstein-esquire doctor, Tony Randall as the \"Operator\", and the aforementioned Gene Wilder.  Recommended (But not for your parents).  7.6 out of 10',\n",
       " b'Bill Paxton stars in and directs this highly original film. Having watched the first time I was by how good it was. The reviews I had heard were OK . As a result I was expecting an average thriller at most .However because of Paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic.The film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . The films strongest point is the storyline which I have to say is highly original and is like I have ever seen before. Well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.',\n",
       " b\"Years ago, the people grew so greedy and hedonistic that they were no longer satisfied with worshiping a mythical god, so the Queen had sex with a bull and produced the Minotaur. Didn't turn out so good, a few deaths were involved, and the creature was placed in a labyrinth beneath the palace. Now every third year eight people are cast into the labyrinth as a sacrifice.  This had surprisingly high production values for a Sci-Fi original. All the sets were quite nicely done, and even the Minotaur looked very good. On the bad side, the characters just didn't have much character, nor screen presence, and it got pretty boring towards the middle. The worst part was that, when trapped in a series of caves with a killer critter, what would a person do? Perhaps be quiet so as not to attract the attention of the beast? Not these folks. The main character especially seems almost incapable of grasping the situation; He yells at the top of his lungs on numerous occasions. Once, the Minotaur is only a few feet away and the guy still can't shut up. He's also convinced that his girlfriend, who was sacrificed three years earlier, might still be alive somehow. I couldn't quite figure out how anyone could be so dumb as to believe such a thing. There's also a woman who screams a lot - not just a regular scream, but a long, long scream. Maybe ten seconds in duration. That's a real joy to listen to.  Two of the more entertaining characters are the high priest and priestess who are in charge of the kingdom. The priest likes smoking from a bull skull, and wants to get it on with the priestess. Seeing that she's his sister, she's rather cool on the idea, and jumps into the labyrinth as well. She's about the only interesting person down there. And one of the few people who speaks in such a manner that you can understand her. I missed a lot of mumbled dialog in this movie, but I don't think it served much purpose anyway.  Overall, I think the Sci-Fi Channel may be getting a little better at movie making (they've certainly had enough practice). This one was almost good.\",\n",
       " b'Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . At the time I couldn`t believe how movies like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . Maybe it is ?',\n",
       " b'This is an \"extra\" of sorts on the DVD for Alla Nazimova\\'s production of Salome. Although this was made in 1933 (or at least released then) it totally made me think of the German Expressionist movement of the 1920s. (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari sprang to mind) You definitely need to already know the story of Sodom & Gomorrah, but as another reviewer stated, the audience back then would have been well-versed in biblical text. As for bible-thumpers who object to sex and violence, they should start with banning the bible since, as this story shows, it is chock full of both. I was curious to know about any censor issues with this film because their is a lot of eroticism with the young male dancers and some bare buttocks, as well as an extremely voluptuous statue of a female torso(at least I think it was a statue). The most surprising image is when the men approach Lot\\'s door and one man has his arm bent upwards and his hand cupped. When he moves out of frame and stops, the shadow of his arm is just to the right of the door-frame and is very clearly in the shape of an erect penis. I wondered if such a graphic image passed the censors because the story was biblical? Either way it was interesting and got the point across very clearly. This is worth watching a few times. It\\'s a bizarre, but interesting piece of film history.',\n",
       " b'\"House Of Evil\" aka \"Dance Of Death\" of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great Boris Karloff and directed by Jack Hill and Juan Ib\\xc3\\xa1nez. Unlike \"Snake People\" (1971), \"The Incredible Invasion\" (also 1971) and \"The Fear Chamber\" (1972) which were all released after Karloff\\'s death in 1969, \"House Of Evil\" was released in 1968, when Karloff was still alive. \"House Of Evil\" is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies, which are without doubt all rather crappy, but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are. I personally prefer \"The Fear Chamber\" and \"House Of Evil\" over the other two, simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme, and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies, the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.  The odd story (I don\\'t know if I can really call it a \\'plot\\') is set somewhere in Europe in the 19th century. After some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out, Mathias Morteval (Karloff), an enthusiastic organ player, invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion, which is full of eerie toys. His kinfolk includes Lucy Durant (Julissa), who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.  I won\\'t give away more of the story, but I can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie. There are some very funny moments, especially some things Karloff\\'s character says. Boris Karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the Horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although (or because) his role is (due to a poor script and and directing) in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor. Just like in the movie\\'s successors \"Snake People\" and \"The Fear Chamber\", the female lead is once again played by Julissa.   Most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish, the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt. The storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense. It is the poor story and dialogue, however, that makes this movie so entertaining to watch. \"House Of Evil\" may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie, but it is certainly as (unintentionally) funny as it is bad. Fans of Ed Wood\\'s movies should be very amused, I personally found it hilarious. Crappy but entertaining nevertheless, and definitely worth watching since there\\'s Boris Karloff in it and due to the fun factor. 3/10',\n",
       " b'*may contain spoilers*   I vaguely remember watching Magnum as a child and liking it then.  Recently I bought all four available season sets and fell in love with it all over again. What is there not to like? The cast gel together so well Larry Manneti (Orville \"rick\" wright) is brilliant. Roger E Mosley is TC and John Hillerman is Higgins. Higgins always pretends to be irritated to death by Our Thomas but he does care (honestly) The stories are engaging and I just love tom Sellecks narration. I like the dark overtones of the fact that these Vietnam Vets are still coming to terms with their experiences.  Favourite episode? the season 4 opener \"Home from the sea \" Magnum is thrown off his surf ski in an accident and forced to endure hours in the water. Cue heartbreaking childhood flashbacks. Will Higgins, TC and Rick get to him in time?. speaking of which all three are getting a funny feeling that something has happened to Magnum.How long can a person tread water for?   \"I\\'ve got to do this for Dad\"  This show had action, Tragedy, Romance, one hunky guy, beautiful scenery,a great cast , humour and a lot of touching moments. One of my favourite shows ever.',\n",
       " b'More historical curiosity that entertainment, \"Manhattan Parade\" is an early sound effort that has dated badly. Perhaps hysterically funny in 1932, the film\\'s static shooting technique only emphasizes the flatness of the jokes. A recurring pair of theatrical producers, played by the comedy team of Smith and Dale, overstays their welcome with a series of tiresome exchanges. Abbott and Costello they are not. The story, which originally had songs, revolves around a theatrical costume company, whose successful president is played by Winnie Lightner. However, Lightner surrenders her feminist credentials early on when she meekly submits to her husband\\'s demands that he run the company and she stay home where she belongs and care for their young son. Needless to say, the philandering husband is no better at business than he is at marriage, and the company falls into debt.  Were it not for Bobby Watson, who plays a designer named Paisley, \"Manhattan Parade\" would rarely be unwound from its reels. However, Watson\\'s limp wristed character is yet another prime example of gay stereotyping in early Hollywood. His threats to slap his foes or quit and stay home to decorate his apartment are evidently accepted by the other characters as quite normal for a sissy. Whining about fabric that should be maroon rather than cerise, Watson underscores filmdom\\'s concept that gays are silly, shallow freaks with no values of consequence in their lives. While not as offensive as some gay characterizations, Paisley, nevertheless, will irritate viewers who are sensitive to negative stereotypes. Interestingly, the film also features two other male characters, a shy, daffy researcher and an effete, snobbish actor, whose sexuality could also be questioned. The concept of the theatrical world as a haven for gays had already taken root.  Unfortunately, there is little to recommend in \"Manhattan Parade\" other than its status as a footnote in gay film history. The performances are competent, although Dickie Moore is a scene-stealer as Lightner\\'s son, and Lloyd Bacon\\'s direction is perfunctory given the restraints of the period. This short comedy will seem to drag on humorlessly for hours to viewers who are not dedicated film historians.',\n",

       " b'About ten years before he decided to venture again in Ruth Rendell universe, Claude Chabrol had transferred to the screen \"a Judgment in Stone\" entitled \"la C\\xc3\\xa9r\\xc3\\xa9monie\" (1995). It was his last great masterwork although he somewhat betrayed the novel. The choice of Sandrine Bonnaire for the main role was ill-advised. Afterwards, his career followed a creative downswing with rather mediocre works such as \"au Coeur Du Mensonge\" (1999) or \"Merci pour Le Chocolat\" (2000). So, could a new excursion in Ruth Rendell territory boost his career again?  Alas no and the title of my summary should give you an inkling about my thoughts on the Chabrol 2004 vintage. However, there were some good elements to make the film compelling and to grab the attention. The first sequence showcases Beno\\xc3\\xaet Magimel and his family in front of the TV news that reveals a murder. Perfect to weave an eerie climate. The big, imposing, eerie house in which Laura Smet lives seems to shelter dark secrets and the \"bridesmaid\" lives in the basement. Chabrol was also interested in the games of truth and lie that link his two main actors and real suspense lies in Magimel\\'s personality dangerously attracted to the bridesmaid. The filmmaker\\'s touch is also discernible at the wedding ceremony where he ridicules its crucial steps. See the church sequence and the feast which echoes to the one in \"Le Boucher\" (1970). While I\\'m evoking this meal, the gastronomy dear to Chabrol has three sequences devoted to it in the whole film. But let\\'s come back to the bulk of the plot. Like \"a Judgement in Stone\", \"La Demoiselle d\\'Honneur\" was an exciting novel to read and again Chabrol skipped over some important points, notably the reasons which prompt the hero to steal the bust from G\\xc3\\xa9rard Courtois (Bernard Le Coq). In the novel, he stole it because he thought that Courtois was a vulgar man, but here Magimel\\'s motivations to steal the bust remain blurred.  The thrust of the novel and so of the film is a man who gradually loses the control of his everyday life facing a sensual, attractive disturbing young woman. However, things aren\\'t looking good because there\\'s an absence of unnerving climate and the scenario seems to have been sedately written, especially near the end. In another extent, I know what I\\'m going to write is questionable but I do think that Chabrol contemporary films suffer from the choice of the actors (see bland Jacques Dutronc in \"Merci pour Le Chocolat\" or Jacques Gamblin in \"au Coeur Du Mensonge\") and sadly \"la Demoisele d\\'Honneur\" isn\\'t an exception to the rule. Magimel\\'s character isn\\'t credible at all. He should get bogged down in madness as he\\'s deeply in love with Smet but it isn\\'t discernible on the screen. Laura Smet (Johnny Hallyday\\'s daughter) has a monotonous acting while Bernard Le Coq\\'s part is underwritten. Michel Duchaussoy who was brilliant in \"Que la B\\xc3\\xaate Meure\" (1969) is relegated to a minor tramp role unworthy of his wide acting skills.  So, an absence of interest for this story of manipulation is surely due to its actors and also because like for \"la C\\xc3\\xa9r\\xc3\\xa9monie\", Chabrol made dull Rendell\\'s novel. Mr Chabrol, let\\'s put it this way: the best of your work is far behind you in time (roughly the dusk of the sixties and the dawn of the seventies) and you will probably never reach this scale again. How about contemplating retirement?',\n",
       " b\"Out of all the Species movies series, this one takes the cake! After the offspring of Sil, this new breed of alien was doing the same thing: finding a mate for her offspring. Then there's another alien who wants to cause trouble by killing everyone in her path. Going to different places for some answers, someone gets offed. Who to trust, who to avoid it's hard to say there. The reason why I don't like this movie is because it's way oversexed, the plot was rather pointless, it was weak, decadent, and played out period. The cast of the movie was fine the only one I thought helped was the guy from the first Species movie as the motel manager who was indeed the original one. Everyone else just didn't sell me. Species 1, 2, and 3 gave out promises: 1 was subtle, 2 was slightly intense, 3 was hardcore and extreme. The 4 one is NOT a keeper in my book! SORRY! 1 STAR!\",\n",

I am dumber for having seen this film.  The gunfight scenes are anything but exciting, with the actors staring out into space with pained expressions.  The time travel details were screwed up on multiple occasions. The focus was solely on SFX at the expense of a coherent theory of time travel. Folks, you don't have to get time travel right, but if you're gonna try, then stick to your own rules.  The soundtrack was strange to say the least. Yes, some movies can pull off an odd song at an unexpected time to great effect. When you try to do it throughout the film, it just becomes sloppy and confusing.  Poor acting, horrible science, bad directing and confusing soundtrack... This movie takes a fun premise and turns it into a painful experience.\",\n",

The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It\\'s too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clich\\xc3\\xa9d lines, \"Are you ready, Pardner?\" purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire. Avoid.',\n",
       " b\"We had bought the DVD for this disaster of a film for our son on Christmas and we finally got around to watching it. We planned a whole family fun night around this movie thinking it would be the perfect ending to a nice dinner out. Holy cow, were we wrong!!! This has got to be the WORST animated movie to come out in the past 10 years. There was an absolutely horrible script driving the lousy computer generated animation (by the way, computer animated films are becoming very very bad lately) along with the horrible voice over work by these talentless actors. It's funny how whenever there is an animated movie in the works, the studios always seem to find one or two actors who are hot at the time: Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, and one or two actors who are basically begging for work: David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett. Dreamworks needs to stop delving into the animated world for a while and give the movie going public something to look forward to that is actually worth their time.\",\n",
       " b'Hospital horror Dark Place is the creation of awful writer Garth Marenghi (Matthew Holness), who wrote, directed and starred. He claims it is deep and inspirational, when in fact it is just shoddy and awful.  Darkplace isn\\'t joke orientated, its the terrible production and acting that provides all the laughs, that mainly come from Garth\\'s publisher, Dean Learner (Richard Ayocade) who plays the hospital boss Thornton Reed. His inability to do two things at once when it comes to acting (for example deliver a line and hang up a phone) is hilarious to watch.   Some of the highlights include a \"dirt bike\" chase through a forest (using tiny children\\'s bicycles), a doctor being attacked by a steam iron and another being chased by a possessed stapler, a woman turning into broccoli and Dean Learner trying to justify how he punched a child actor. However, you have to see it to realize how funny it really is, my words can\\'t do enough.   Darkplace won\\'t appeal to everyone\\'s tastes, but still it looks like it will probably be a cult hit. If its ever repeated, its worth a look just to see what you think. It provides a refreshing change from awful reality TV and soap operas.  I, for one, can\\'t wait for the DVD and/or a second batch of episodes \"from the Channel 4 vaults\". I give it a solid 10/10.',\n",

It has a very tidy plot that takes our delightful duo to America and contains one of my favourite sequences as we watch a (critical to the plot) book of matches go from person to person at a social gathering. Holmes gets to act up as an eccentric art collector and Watson does what he does best, comedy relief. The ending perhaps could of packed a bigger punch for me personally, but all in all it's yer above average detective drama acted out with the usual style from the regulars, 7/10.\",\n",

I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times. So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film, he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect, and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all. He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone (if they do anymore), creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature, and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways.

Nevertheless Dr.Cardan, who has been the psychiatrist in charge of the patient for years, insists his body must be burnt. But three male medical students and their female friends steals the body for their party in an empty house nearby the cemetery. Soon Dr.Cardan and Cap.Ancira begin to find the body, but this night is the Halloween so that five local kids go to the problematic cemetery for tests of their courage... This Mexican zombie film, which consists of chaotic elements of Halloween, the Evil Dead and Death Screams, is so multifariously bad that I can write about only three major points. First, the lightning is technically problematic. This film, of which total running time is 91 minutes, has only 8 minutes day-time scenes, and 90 per cent of the whole is night-time scenes with amateurishly poor lightning so that at least half of the film seems to be almost black-and-white. Second, the dialogue is much more problematic. For instance, the psychiatrist, Dr.Cardan explains two contradictory facts to the policeman, Cap.Ancira, namely, 1)the patient's body must be cremated, and 2)the patient's body can be destroyed only with an old document named Black Book. Just what kind of foolishness is this? Maybe Dr.Cardan,M.D. is the same kind of more famous Dr.Butcher,Medical Deviate. Indeed the entire dialogue is so childish that words of the psychiatrist and of the five elementary-school kids are almost exchangeable. And third, the ending scene is terribly bad. I can tell what exactly it is, but I can tell its unbelievable irrationality turns the whole film to be some kind of four-sided triangle.\",\n",

When they visit the Mexican witch Gloria (Miriam Colon), the woman advises that a powerful evil force is chasing the reincarnation of her son and drowning the other children to bring pain to their mothers.  \"The Cry\" is a boring, pointless and unpleasant mess about a Mexican legend called \"La Llorona\". This is the first time that I see a reference to this legend, and maybe this movie might make some sense to those that are familiar with \"La Llorona\". However, the screenplay is terrible, without development of characters or situations, and there is an absolute lack of explanation about everything that happens in the story. Why the evil spirit is attacking children in New York? Why the former Wall Street broker Scott has become a New York detective after losing his son? Why Maria was able to protect her son and why she blinded herself in the end? The lead character Scott is absolutely boring; maybe the actor has felt the turkey he was hired to work. Last but not the least, the theme of mothers drowning babies and children is of an extremely bad taste even for a pseudo-horror movie. My vote is one.  Title (Brazil): \"Gritos da Morte\" (\"Cries of the Death\")',\n",

Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped, cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl didn't look or act Samoan at all, seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this.\",\n",

       " b'For the young Joan Crawford, MGM was the perfect studio. All that gloss, rags to riches, Gable, and gowns. But MGM had a hard time with actresses as they aged and the old formulas weren\\'t working anymore - Shearer, Garbo, and Crawford being three such examples. The other two quit, but Joan went over to Warner Brothers and revived her career.  It was a good move. I love the Crawford films at Warner\\'s. They were grand potboilers enlivened by her presence.  Possessed is post-war, and after the war, the new rage was psychology. This movie is full of it. I\\'m not sure the diagnosis and terminology is correct in the film, but in layman\\'s term, Crawford plays a total whack job. As her story unfolds to a doctor, she\\'s a nurse taking care of Raymond Massey\\'s wife, and she\\'s seeing Van Heflin on a casual basis. When she falls in love with him, Heflin announces he\\'s restless because of the war and is taking off. And that\\'s when Joan takes off - emotionally. She becomes completely obsessed with him, and this leads to hallucinations, hysteria, and finally a psychotic break. She has able assistance by Heflin, who pops in and out and gets involved with Crawford\\'s stepdaughter (Crawford is now married to the widower Massey). When the movie begins, she\\'s wandering the street saying \"David,\" which is Heflin\\'s name in the movie.  One of the posters suggested Tyrone Power for this role. I\\'m all for him in any movie, and it\\'s true, the presence of a big star as David would have elevated the film to a grander status. As it is, it\\'s an excellent vehicle for Crawford, who runs the gamut of emotions.  Raymond Massey is stoic and solid as Crawford\\'s new husband, and the lovely Geraldine Brooks, who died too soon, plays the stepdaughter. Her youthful vivacity is in sharp contrast to Crawford\\'s borderline insanity and makes for great watching. Heflin, as the object of all the possession obsession, is smooth and detached.  But make no mistake about it. This is Joan Crawford\\'s show and she makes the most of it. The script will keep you interested, and you won\\'t be able to take your eyes off of Joan descending into madness.',\n",
       " b\"I stumbled upon Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking I could deal with an average movie. This movie however was slightly below average, yet watchable. The script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a B-level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good. The plot borders on that of Saw, teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more, but that is really where the comparison ends. Nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main fault that I found in Nine dead, was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming, in a bad way. Barring any spoilers I have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly. Decent flick, bad acting and ending though...\",\n",
       " b'The major themes of the movie are not so original as some people are lead to think. The fact that Kim Ki-Duk is Koreean and uses that environment is, of course,\"exotic\" but this doesn\\'t mean the movie has anything to say. I am puzzled as to the overall meaning implied here. From what I could understand the whole thing was about plastic surgery and how bad it is...unfortunately nothing more. There was a great potential in the idea, but it realization is simply preposterous. I don\\'t necessarily ask for \"reality\" in a movie but in this case only something painfully real would have hit the spot. The plot devices are laughable, to name some of them, the death of the male character at the end, the use of the locations is unrealistic (especially the coffee shop). The actors don\\'t seem to bother too much with being at least mildly pleasant and making the viewer interested in their problems.   I heard the director had a few issues with Koreeans when he made this movie, because he is believed to portray his country in dark colors. Well, considering some of his early movies this is certainly so. Though it is not something inherently bad in doing this if you manage to convey the artistry you desire, I think that there are some things in Time which are pointless and through an unjustified shadow on Koreea. First of all the violence, utterly gratuitous, who could ever believe that people who react as they do in public spaces are left alone by the police? In this movie you have a doctor beating the living day-light out of a guy he was having a meeting with. And by the way, is it customary in Koreea for the doctors to break their \"vow of silence\" and share the details of their patients with whoever wants it? Aren\\'t there laws against behavior such as this? Wouldn\\'t a doctor loose his reputation, credentials and probably freedom if he attempted such a thing? And how about those telephone companies who erase your number in only a few minutes...?  Most of Kim Ki-Duk\\'s fans don\\'t seem to be bothered by all these obvious flaws and think that a good idea makes a good movie. Some reviewers identified elements common to other movies, they are right. The plot is not based on original ideas. I always thought watching this at Hitchcock\\'s Vertigo, identity change, betrayal, mistrust, obsessive love, trying to reach out to a person that\\'s no longer there...no plastic surgery but, again, that\\'s not meant to be the essential point here. What is present in Vertigo but lacks in Time is: suspense, good acting, clarity (Kim doesn\\'t seem to give a damn about this aspect in none of his movies), and especially a coherent meaning for the whole picture. Any director is good if he manages to obtain his goals. This movie fails completely, instead of leaving me wandering what\\'s wrong with today\\'s society (which is a thing I don\\'t have to be reminded by a movie anyway) it left me wandering what was wrong with the director. Is it something related to cultural differences? Then how come I like Kurosawa or Ozu so much? Sorry for not being useful...!',\n",
       " b'I liked \"Quid Pro Quo,\" a LOT. Do NOT be put off by the subject matter; that\\'s just \"local color\" for a good, old-fashioned mystery, one that opens up\" into not only revelation, but self-revelation. For those who like mystical mysteries, it\\'s even got a pair of magical shoes that perform miracles.  The film is what it is not only because of a masterful script, but because of two actors who basically eat the screen with fine performances -- Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga. Stahl plays a public radio reporter who is semi-paralyzed; the accident in his youth that killed his parents left him in a wheelchair. He gets a tip from an anonymous woman that at a local hospital, a man recently walked in and tried to bribe one of the residents to amputate his leg. Following up on it, he finds that not only is it true, but that there is a subculture out there that *envies* those in wheelchairs, and wants to become like them. They call themselves \"wannabees,\" and have been known to cripple themselves or have others do it for them so that they can live their \"inner dream\" of being confined to a wheelchair themselves.  His investigation leads him to a mysterious and beautiful young woman, played by Vera Farmiga in a performance that is going to get her a LOT of work in the film biz. She\\'s tremendous -- innocent, sexy, conflicted, and at every turn of the plot the person who leads Stahl\\'s character deeper and deeper into his investigation of why on earth someone would *want* to be confined to a wheelchair.  It\\'s a great flick, by a first-time writer/director, someone who IMO is To Be Watched. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " b\"Pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the 'Trivia' section) about how it came to be. It seems as if destiny conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.  Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elocution. As a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer.  Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan like her own. The other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (the music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (the d.o.p). Their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.  Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.\",\n",
       " b\"As a kid, I loved this game. I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.  You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind.  Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.   As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.  Pros:  Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.  Great tunes.  Easy to get into and hard to put down.  Cons:  Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.  Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.  Lack of combo moves.  Lack of decent weapons.  Bad guy models are repeated far too often.

       " b\"What is it with Julie Delpy? I have only seen a hand-full of her movies but she always manages to surprise and excite. She acts brilliantly as the title character in Tarantinoesque Killing Zo\\xc3\\xab, manages to stay convincing in the far-fetched An American Werewolf in Paris and is great as a young lover in Before Sunrise and as a confident woman in the sequel Before Sunset. This brings us to 2 days in Paris which could easily be mistaken for a continuation of the Sunrise/Sunset movies. And that would be a huge mistake: 2 Days in Paris is a dialogue driven romantic comedy dissecting a couples quasi-dysfunctional relationships and how they have to come to terms with their individual imperfections to be able to truly coexist as a pair. Though that may not sound like compelling viewing its actually hugely entertaining as it dissects a million small mix-ups which can make or break a couple.  Adam Goldberg is compelling as the sarcastic yet witty American boyfriend visiting Paris for the first time with his girlfriend. What follows is a series of hugely entertaining misunderstandings involving cross cultural differences, hilarious conversations in broken French with family members and a series of unplanned rendezvous with former lovers all of which combine to drive him high up the paranoia ladder.  It's refreshing to find out that not only does Julie Delpy act brilliantly as the naive and clumsy Marion but she also directed and wrote it, heck she even composed the soundtrack.  The lasting message of this movie is although you might hate 80% of the things your lover does if you just cant live without them don't lose them\",\n",
       " b\"I watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend. I got my judgment teeth pulled out so I didn't feel very good.  I ended up liking it big time. It's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic, and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail.  The acting is on it's prime level. Two of the women that I lust the most star and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and charming as always while Kate Beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance. Bill Pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities.  There are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience. Plus it shows the difficult times at Thailand.  This is an underrated movie. Not many films like this one have come up in recent history. It should make you reflex about many things...\",\n",

       " b'We know Bogart liked to keep working. The movies he made in the late Forties through the mid Fifties, however, sometimes give \"work\" a bad name. He veered effortlessly between fine movies that to this day continue to challenge, satisfy or do both and movies that are nothing more than nearly forgotten commercial hackwork. He knew what he was turning out; he called Sirocco a stinker. What an odd and undiscriminating selection process he and his agent must have had. In 1950 he makes Chain Lightening but then makes In a Lonely Place. In 1951 it\\'s Sirocco and then The African Queen. In 1953 it\\'s Battle Circle and then Beat the Devil (maybe a confusing failure, but not hackwork).   With Sirocco Bogart gives us Harry Smith, a gunrunner who finds himself in Damascus. The year is 1925. The French run things. A lot of Syrians don\\'t like that at all. They\\'re called \"rebels.\" Harry? He doesn\\'t care one way or another as long as he\\'s paid. Harry is tired, sour, cynical and a skeptic. He doesn\\'t believe in anything except money and the value of his own hide. He\\'s Bogart. Harry quickly finds himself involved with a martinet of a French general named LaSalle (Everett Sloane) who thinks shooting five Syrians for every dead French soldier will be educational for everyone; a sympathetic French colonel named Feroud (Lee J. Cobb) who thinks he can avoid bloodshed if he can just sit down and talk things over with the rebel leaders, especially Emir Hassan (Onslow Stevens); and Feroud\\'s mistress, a cool drink of water named Violette (Marta Toren), a beautiful woman who seems to be aroused more by the prospect of shopping than the prospect of making love. In other words, a courtesan to scriptwriters, a sophisticated prostitute to the more realistic; something akin to a wealthy CEO\\'s trophy wife. Harry meets Violette, wants her and comes close to falling for her. This sets up some tension between himself and Colonel Feroud. All the while Harry is trying to extricate himself from an arms deal gone very, very wrong. By the end of the movie no one has gained much of anything, although it appears Violette will have the time to do more shopping.   At one point in Sirocco Violette says to Harry Smith, \"What a man! You\\'re so ugly! Yes, you are! How can a man so ugly be so handsome?\" Ugly? Quasimodo, that\\'s ugly. Bogart may not have been handsome, but he had style, a unique screen personality and the good fortune to star in three -- count \\'em, three -- iconic career-making movies in less than two years. High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca carved Bogart\\'s screen persona so deeply in granite that even hackwork like Sirocco scarcely makes a chip. When we see Harry we\\'re really seeing Roy, Sam and Rick.   There\\'s no reason to watch this movie unless you\\'re fond of Bogart and have an hour and a half to waste. But if you watch, remember Everett Sloane. He was a fine, fine actor who seldom found memorable parts in Hollywood. He was a member of Orson Welles\\' Mercury Theater and came to Hollywood with Welles. He wound up in the Fifties doing a ton of television shows. He killed himself in 1965 when he was 55. My best memories of Sloane include Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane (1941); Arthur Bannister in The Lady from Shanghai (1947); Mario Belli in Prince of Foxes (1949); Dr. Eugene Brock in The Men (1950); and, powerfully, Walter Ramsey in Patterns (1956).',\n",

It is the film\\'s biggest flaw by far that it just doesn\\'t make any damn sense.  Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter \"in charge\" and goes off to World War I where he is killed. Then we flash forward to present day (1942) and total confusion. The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years, and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them. This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script, more holes in it than The Warren Report. What happened to the Gaylord fortune? If the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters? Who the devil is this Barclay clown? And why is he able to take someone\\'s home away from them? The questions just pile on top of more questions.  The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay, who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone, taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt; yet no one besides Fiona (Barbara Stanwick) seems to particularly dislike this cretin. Why? None of these questions are ever answered. We instead just follow Fiona\\'s life from one train wreck to another, the evil Barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child. What does she do? Shoot him? Set him on fire? No, too logical. In a completely improbably wrap-up, this woman, who\\'s only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides mid-sentence (literally) that she does not hate him, she loves him. And they\\'re going to live happily ever after. All of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I\\'ll fall in love with you. On what planet does that happen? I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today.',\n",

Roger Corman directed this...it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie...sadly, it doesn't work at all. This movie has a following but damned if I know why.  It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place. Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible -- they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help. Also, the movie is VERY sleazy. Rape, murder, incest, torture, beatings, drug abuse, homosexuality (portrayed negatively unfortunately)...you name it. I'm no prude, but this movie rubs your face in it. For instance, the opening scene has a young girl (about 13) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her!  This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big.  All in all, a must miss.\",\n",

So their son falls in love with a daughter of two gay men. I don't anything about her mother which makes the impression that she did not have a mother or who is actually her father. I only saw a couple episodes and was not impressed by the writing. The rest of the cast seem easily forgettable in their roles. The gay couple is wealthy, educated, and cultured stereotype of the gay community. One male owns or works in an art gallery. Another male is a teacher in an elementary school. It kind bothers me that the Irish catholic O'Neils owns a bar in Boston. It's just all stereotypes and I'm not crazy about watching stereotypes or being preached too. I think the daughter's mother or actual parentage should be addressed.\",\n",

Of course, the word is used many times and in many ways (noun, verb, etc.). Experts discussing their experience with the word f*ck include liberals, conservatives, a \\'cunning linguist\\', comedians, porn stars and Miss Manners.  The film is balanced and informative. It shows how positive energy is released while using the word f*ck. As well, discussed are appropriate ways to express frustration and copulation.

At Hotdocs film festival 2006, where I saw this film, the audience received it very well and everybody begins discussing and giggling again as they leave the theater. This is the kind of movie you see and imagine discussions on other similar words.',\n",
       " b\"I was transfixed by this show since my first viewing. One man in the wild for seven days - no camera crew, nothing but a multi-tool and some basic equipment. The show is set up to more or less mimic a typical survival situation - lost at sea, lost while hiking, a plane crash in the wilderness, etc. It adds an extra element of credibility and realism.  The host then proceeds to do what he must to survive with what he has available, and to make use of or anticipate a use for what he is left with, be it a damaged bicycle, plane, parachute, backpack, etc. Les is alone in this, performing everything including all of his own camera work. So when we see him walking off into the distance or climbing down a bluff, he has to walk or climb all the way back to his camera to retrieve it.  The wilderness settings are incredibly varied, from the arctic to the jungles, tropical islands to open ocean. We get a taste of just about every possible terrain as well, from mountains to desert plains.  The thing I like the most about the show is its practicality. Les doesn't take unnecessary risks for the sake of entertainment. He cooks his food whenever he can, doesn't attempt unrealistic tasks that would set him up for injury, and otherwise attempts to conserve his energy as much as possible. He also stresses the psychological aspects of survival, focusing on keeping his spirits up to avoid the depression and lonely solitude of his situation.  I don't have much criticism for the show. Les plans to be rescued in seven days, and it is often easy to see this anticipation in his routine. In a way this reduces the tension, since we know he will be saved at a predetermined time. But then again if someone isn't rescued from being lost in a few days, then their chance of survival diminishes dramatically. It is not realistic to eschew certain safety considerations and prolong one's suffering merely because I think it might make for a more unpredictable show.   So then my complaints really are minor and perhaps frivolous, since this remains among my favorite shows on TV. Practical, interesting, often exciting, and filled with useful survival information, this show is great and deserves the success it enjoys. Enjoy with my recommendations.\",\n",
       " b\"In this 1941 comedy, we are presented with two intelligent, beautiful women who are seriously smitten with a man who can hardly open his mouth without lying. The story ends with a major lie, and she accepts him. Either women in '41 were much more stupid or forgiving than today, or somehow people then thought that lying was cute and funny. The movie is terrible, and any women who are attracted to this man should be sentenced to marrying a serial liar.  Dennis Morgan was a familiar figure in the '40's, and was used to comedies. But Morgan's role in this movie is a little out of character, in his being a serial philanderer and a chronic liar. It's not difficult to see his appeal on short notice, but any woman who got to know him should have been repulsed.\",\n",
       " b'This film, seeming so simple on the surface, was a profound study of how people\\'s lives are affected by judgment and rejection. Two families of sons, same father, different mothers, have spent their respective lives \"knowing\" that they belonged either to the favored family or to the rejected family. The reason that one family was so bitterly rejected is never really known, and it doesn\\'t need to be explained. The movie is about the effect this has had on the self-worth of the characters. Who can say how one group can be judged as worthy, and the other as unworthy? As American as this story is, it made me think of the Middle East conflict, where sons of different mothers are fighting and killing each other. It was so telling how the older sons had names that weren\\'t even really names, merely descriptions, while the younger sons had actual names as though they were the true human beings. I found the ending to be hopeful, and I appreciated how the child who sat on the porch with his dad and uncle DID have a real person\\'s name, yet was at once \"boy, kid, son.\"  I viewed this film at the Palm Springs Film Festival, where many audience members came up to the director afterward to say, \"I\\'m not from Arkansas, but I know these people.\" I loved the air conditioner scene, the inspiration for which Mr. Nichols said he actually witnessed in real life.  I see that this is scheduled for limited US release on Mar 26. I hope a lot of people get a chance to see it.',\n",
       " b\"Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor. Instead, it's a poorly acted, witless look into low budget and uninspired film making. The plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws throughout, and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety. The movie anticipates shows like 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing the movie has going for it (besides its brevity) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of New York City's interiors and expansive exteriors. Unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest watching practically any other movie.\",\n",
       " b'This was really a fun movie that had some great car action. The trailer I saw on TV looked pretty good but I didn\\'t have much expectation since it was a cable movie. I ended up pleasantly surprised. The old and new GTOs looked great in the movie and the autoshow scene was pretty cool. I really liked Dennis Hopper\\'s character and really liked the younger talent. The ending was a big surprise! I didn\\'t see that coming. There was a nice development of the characters while still maintaining the action that I was looking for. The creator of the \"Fast and the Furious\" and \"XXX\" didn\\'t disappoint for this cable flick. While, it may not have been worthy of the big screen, I would actually watch it again. For a made-for-TV movie, I gave it a 9. I usually won\\'t bare to sit through made-for-TV movie. This one was worth it.',\n",
       " b'Watching CBS\\'s \"Surrender, Dorothy\", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it\\'s a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses, it isn\\'t any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim, these phony people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man, who wears muscle shirts to tell us he\\'s gay, hears Diane Keaton say, \"Surrender, Dorothy\" and actually asks, \"That\\'s from \"The Wizard of Oz\", right?\"...no, genius, it\\'s from \"Citizen Kane\"!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits), but it doesn\\'t sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here, she\\'s a crazed harpy who doesn\\'t learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets it\\'s about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom, who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, \"It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there\". I can\\'t imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer, muddled and baffling. It\\'s deranged.',\n",
       " b'I\\'m never sure what this movie is trying to be, or what point it is trying to make. Different ideas start, but there is no finish. Why did Norman Waters have to build the ark?

       " b'Whether it is the incredibly low budget Lost rip-off, retarded script, or just incredibly low budget-ness itself, this movie will destroy braincells. See this and feel dumber. It\\'s amazing.  I see these crappazz movies for Bruce Boxleitner. Well don\\'t -- his role is pathetic and he dies anyways.  The \"special effects\" are unwatchable. Worse than Mortal Kombat Annhilation (I know, unheard of).  I am getting sick and tired of formula commodity movies whose pre-fabbed scripts are no different from commercials. This is one of those.',\n",
       " b\"OMG! The only reason I'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from that, how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time... There are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, Joel Zwick. He brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved. Don't waste your time like I did; but then, I enjoy a good train wreck. Geez, now the system is telling me I need more lines-- here ya go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now THAT was funnier than anything in the movie...\",\n",
       " b\"So, there's a Bigfoot roaming around out in the woods. Lance Henriksen and a couple of buddies are out hunting it. They all get killed early on. I guess they couldn't afford to pay them for the whole movie. Another guy who's in a wheelchair is staying at a cabin, along with his therapist. Across the way is another cabin, this one full of young college girls. The guy in the wheelchair spends the movie looking through binoculars at the Bigfoot hanging around outside the girls' cabin. Yes, Hitchcock did something similar. The girls keep accusing him of being a peeping tom. Eventually our Yeti knocks off most of the girls, and the sole survivor takes refuge with the guy in the wheelchair. There's the usual cornball climax and the usual cornball setup for a sequel.  Overall, it wasn't any worse than average for a Sci-Fi original. The female characters were uninteresting and interchangeable clich\\xc3\\xa9s, Lance Henriksen and his buddies at least had a bit of personality, and the guy in the wheelchair did a good job, but never really rose to the lever of being interesting. The worst part was the Bigfoot, he looked extremely silly. He had a huge grin on his face every time we saw him. There was a tiny bit of nudity and a fair amount of gore.  I'd recommend this if you're a lover of B-movies and in the mood for something vaguely interesting to watch on a Tuesday night. Don't wait to watch it on a weekend, weekends deserve something better like Sabertooth or Chupacabra Terror. At least the characters in those movies had personalities.\",\n",

Just plain torture.  I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.  You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it\\'s ONLY holes - and the excitement factor? Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.  My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK\\'d this drivel, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: \"Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are idiots!\"  I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse.

       " b'I remember watching this movie back in \\'55 in Great Falls, Montana. It was a fun flick. Sterling Hayden did his usual Sterling Hayden performance. It was not Godfather worthy, but acceptable. The scenery was familiar to us, being Montanans. I actually did some lumber jacking in my college years. It is heavy work. After the movie, we stopped at a soda fountain. I stuffed the jukebox with a couple of quarters and punched in the song, \"Timberjack\". It was set to play twelve times. (If you put in a quarter instead of a nickle, you got six plays.) After the fourth play, the proprietor came over and unplugged the jukebox. We laughed our way out of the place.',\n",
       " b'As I am always looking for something new and unique, I watched this film online. I thought that it would be just another \"B\" rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters. All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed. The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.  This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp, \"Dumb and Dumber\" or blood and guts. This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.  I would prefer this movie to many \"A\" rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.  I highly recommend this movie.',\n",
       " b\"I first saw this movie some years ago on TV having missed it at the cinema, and found it very entertaining. The story and 'visuals', though not fantastic, was I think good enough to hold the shortest of attention spans. Mine included. The film is set in a health club in Los Angeles, with John Travolta starring as an ace investigative reporter for real-life mag Rolling Stone. It also features a brilliant funked-up disco soundtrack, featuring long forgotten artists like Jermaine Jackson, Jermaine Stewart, and Carol Lynn Towns, and follows Travolta's charchter as he writes a piece about the health club scene, and courts one of the fitness instructors there, played by Jaimie Lee Curtis. Unbeknownst to her, he's using her and some of her patrons, in order to write a sleazy story for his voracious boss played by the real Rolling Stone editor. It's not hard to guess what happens next, as Travolta and Curtis fall for each other, Curtis finds a copy of his article on his computer which causes conflict between them, and we get to see some fine acting from Jaimie Lee during those scenes. Travolta decides to kill the story, but his angered boss enlists the help of photographer played by Anne DeSalvo, in order to rewrite it without Travolta's knowledge.  But the best parts of the film, has to be scenes set during Curtis' classes (the visuals I mentioned earlier). Along with the pumping disco soundtrack, these scenes are excillerating to watch - and not just for the sexy hard bodies. When this film appeared again on TV recently, I just had to record it, and watch it all over again. Not because I'm perverted you understand, but because it's so...kitsch, and seems to be indicative of the silly hedonistic LA scene of the early 1980s. It has some truly funny moments also. Watch for the scene where Travolta searches for Jaimie Lee in a hotel holding a convention, which features Boy George look-alikes. It's hilarious!!\",\n",
       " b\"IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68. Doesn't really matter, except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first art works to merge the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction isn't really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful. Certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.\",\n",
       " b'I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred. After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? \"Nuts to that\", I said. So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell.   Except..   Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America\\'s Greatest Comic Character Actor. This guy plays Belushi\\'s brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold. How good is he really? Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. That\\'s like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he\\'s in!',\n",
       " b'Having read all the comments before I would just like to reinforce that the film is about innocence and idealism. I don\\'t think the director really is doing \"propaganda\" for leftist ideas or revolutions. The \"leftie\" characters were aptly shown as naive and even outright dumb. The capitalist wasn\\'t a monster or inhuman either.  I don\\'t think the \"alternative\" end explanation for Hardenberg being an accomplice makes any sense. He obviously remains \"establishment\". The message on the wall is clearly for him. In the end I was saddened that Hardenberg didn\\'t have some empathy or learn a bit himself. I think he really was once a SDS member and a revolutionary himself, though naturally he played it up a bit to save his skin.  It also shows that life and the system eventually get us all. We end up boring and all about conformity. Our youthful rebellion becoming a comfortable obedience. We just want our paychecks and suburban homes.  Its also sad to read so many commentaries about \"lefty\" film... the film is so much more than just the politics in it.',\n",
       " b\"This is the first time I decided to write a review. At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child. Cousteau and the life he led captivated me and evoked in me a sense of adventure-seeking and fascination with the sea. Wes Anderson managed to not only recapture the Cousteau mystique with a twist but to also take me back to this wonderful time.  The Life Aquatic is a brilliant and unique work of art with a wonderful cast. The various subplots are beautifully thought out. Those who cannot connect with this film were simply born at the wrong period. Those who cannot appreciate it are simply much too rigid to understand creative movie-making.  I truly hope they make a sequel! Afterall, Cousteau is known to have faked some scenes. Esteban's death could have been part of a ploy. Alternatively, Esteban could have truly survived the attack and was later spit out by the shark near some island ... Let's go Wes! Give us another! You have a winning formula ...  Best regards, Marc\",\n",
       " b\"If you want to see several long scenes of Our Young Hero whining about why he doesn't want to save the world, this is the film for you. Add in every bad low-budget fantasy film clich\\xc3\\xa9 that has ever made you groan and you can pretty much predict the contents of this film.  What's really a shame is that the main actors are so very good. What a waste of talent. The special effects were fine but they kept repeating them , so they lost some impact by the last part of the movie.  ---Possible Spoiler---  Don't miss the exciting scene where Our Hero uses his World Saving Powers to make an erect knife dance between two round salt and pepper shakers in the creepiest sexual innuendo ever to grace a children's film. When his unappreciative honey goes off with Our Hero's brother, Our Hero uses his powers to throw the same knife at them as they leave the house. Talk about unsavory symbolism! I think the director may, just possibly, have some unhealthy issues about women.\",\n",

Nice film. Damn, Meg is a babe, eh?\",\n",
       " b'The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken Americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans.   The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so. You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.  I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. I just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact American indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!',\n",
       " b'\"The Empire in Africa\" is a courageous examination of a tragic and complex topic, the civil war in Sierra Leone, its propaganda-driven portrayal in the international media, the global commercial interests at stake, the regional and international contribution to the continued violence and the effects on the civilian population of war and poverty in a country that is extremely wealthy in natural resources. (See, I said it was complex.) The events, the various parties and issues could easily have become hopelessly confused to a viewer --so much of the film\\'s success is that its many interviews with people from all sides and a remarkable collection of footage from various sources, is edited so that it that manages to tell the story in a clear way. It is guaranteed to arouse the viewer\\'s indignation at the role of the rest of the world (including other African countries as well as Western states such as the UK, France and the USA, exercising political and economic influence through bilateral relations and through the United Nations) in prolonging the war in this small country. It is also an indictment of the international news media for accepting the easy answers and official stories and not digging deeper for the truth.  Warning: The film has some very gory images; however I don\\'t feel it was gratuitous but necessary to tell the truth of a story that has been much misrepresented. Some of the most disturbing footage was of violence by regional troops aligned with the government, which Director/Producer Phillipe Diaz revealed (during the Q & A after the screening at Slamdance Film Festival) had been given to him by a Sierra Leonian government official who wanted the truth revealed, although it clearly meant he had to flee his country forever. M. Diaz, who has faced a good deal of pressure not to show this film, and who himself cannot return to Sierra Leone or to Nigeria, had to disguise the true focus of the film he was making from the authorities as long as possible, finally handing over a set of \\'dummy\\' tapes and smuggling the real ones out of the country.',\n",

If someone truly wanted to make an awful movie, fine, but why use the title and lead characters from Ms. Howard's book when the story is completely different? There is no Grant Shaw in the book, Grant Shaw is the actor from Melrose Place. And who is Mrs. Beacham? She is not in the book, either.  Anyone who has read this book and may be tempted to watch this piece of cheap filmmaking, don't bother. It is not worth it. Even if it wasn't based on a Howard book, this movie is not worth your time. Paint your nails, hammer some nails, eat some nails, anything other than watching this drivel makes more sense. And I hope Ms. Howard has more sense than turning over her work to producers who will butcher it.\",\n",

Second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family, with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies. The brothers are very close, yet are not judgmental. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not needed in the end. I understand that Leo's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people, but I believed it was the right choice for him. I can't believe that this was a french television programme. It had great production values. I gave this movie a ten, and I think you will too, once you have seen it.\",\n",

A few centuries later group of archeologists started to do the research nearby ruins of church. This fact made locals very suspicious and unfriendly, because of superstition of murdered nun\\'s revenge. It\\'s question of time when sinner\\'s ghosts came back to get their death toll.  Fulci always goes from one extreme to another. Once his movies were full of suspense [\"Murder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes \"] or gore [\"Zombie Flesh Eaters\"]. Demonia is a try to mix these two. But, it\\'s failed. Fulci tries all of his suspense tricks such as eye close-up, sudden zooms and creating orinirique atmosphere. But it makes this film worse. Close-up looks really poor and zooms are very annoying. Oh, we can\\'t forget about music. Sometimes it honestly can build atmosphere but it\\'s only one scene. In other ones, especially in ruins where we hear drunk organist\\'s symphony it\\'s driving insane. Gore also lets down. There are only two scenes, of which one is typical for Lucio (eyes scratched out by a cat)but second one - tearing man apart - really satisfied me. The biggest flop is main character and strictly speaking acting. Her looks brought me a lot of fun. For example, in scene where Paul (leader of archeologists) says to her that they must leave her look is wonderful! It\\'s similar to kid\\'s look when they are forbidden to eat sweets/play computer games/whatever. But all of these are nothing when we compare it to the ending! I have seen many bad movies, but it\\'s first really PA-THE-TIC ending in my life. There is nothing better than view of burning nun in company of soap opera\\'s music! As for me, it\\'s probably top bottom of Lucio Fulci\\'s movies and it\\'s a little pity, because the plot is quite good.',\n",

Sweden, especially its far north, is not my idea of heaven -30 degree C winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me, but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in God\\'s own country.  The storyline here is a familiar one. Acclaimed international musician Daniel suffers health breakdown in mid-career, goes back to the little village in northern Sweden where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir, he turns some unlikely talent into a class act, and they enter a contest held in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the band players of \"Brassed Off\" the models of \"Calendar Girls\" and the dancers of \"the Full Monty\". But of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing except death is going to stop him.  Despite the somewhat corny story, we get to know and like many of the characters, who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable \"types\\'. I did wonder about the wife-beater being unpunished for so long \\xc2\\x96 Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged (he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of Daniel\\'s youth) and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but marvellously realised by Niklas Falk.  Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel, the frail but driven musician, and there\\'s some nice music as well. I was rapt for the whole two hours. The ending is what you make of it, I guess, but it\\'s not spoiling it to say Daniel achieves what he set out to do.',\n",

Does it get any uglier than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he has acted in 164 movies at this date!! It's true that he was rarely in a major role, but still!\",\n",
       " b'Being an otaku since the days of Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film. Although it has been described as being \"sappy,\" it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do. Since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to \"macho-man\" tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers. The seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get; her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious \"Homing Laser\" and \"Buster Shield\" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true Dracula style) technique. I doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but it cracked me up. Yet all in all, I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.',\n",
       " b'Three slightly self-indulgent stories with a lesbian theme. The problem here is that lesbianism is not just a theme of these stories, it is the theme, and a single (and predictable) prevailing attitude provides each drama with both premise and conclusions. It is not that this attitude is wrong, rather that it robs the dramas of the qualities of breath and moral ambiguity that mark all truly powerful stories. Vanessa Redgrave is excellent in the first part, which thereby moves you although you never feel there is never any scope for anything other than the eventual ending; the other two tales pass without interest. Truly good film makes the viewer feel a little more uneasy and a little less certain about themselves; but the overall tone here is one of celebration, and its a weaker work for that.',\n",
       " b\"Not really, but a sleeper holiday flick for your Xmas party back pocket. I hadn't even pegged it as a holiday film until the ultimate scene. Nice! Stefanie von Pfetten is a scream queen gift to the masses -- one I need to catch up on -- and the movie, while not awesome, combines horror and humor elements to good effect. The loss of the hero's friend isn't overly convincing or deserving of much mourning, and the exchange student scene at the sorority house is slightly unnerving, but on the whole, this is a fun flick worth watching once. I don't really understand IMDb's 10-line text limit for reviews. Is it 10 lines of written text -- in form? -- or on screen? I guess I'm about to find out. May the 65% of this review actually commenting on the movie serve you well.\",\n",

Basically, it looks like talking p*nis. Honestly, it\\'s TOTALLY RIDICULOUS. I worked at a video rental store and rented it. I got off work at 5 pm, walked home (i didn\\'t even have a car at the time), watched the first 20 minutes, ejected the DVD and walked right back to the rental store after walking all the way home, and put it in the drop box. I wouldn\\'t chance being caught dead with this CRAPPY MOVIE in my house or be seen returning this garbage!!!! Afterwards, whenever a customer came up to the rental counter with it, I refused to rent it to them. People asked us for our opinion on movies all of the time and trusted us. I was brutally honest but some people still wanted to rent it. Those that did, I made them rent it from another clerk...not me and promise that clerk that they would not come back mad at us and demand their money back. Of course, I had a great relationship with my customers so they told me that I was right, it was a waste of time and money. Is there a way to give it negative stars, like putting every copy of this HORRIBLE movie that exists in the world into a rocket and shooting the thing straight into the sun??',\n",
       " b\"It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to one cop, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this.  A B-action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid B-action movies this is not for you.\",\n",
       " b'I think the problem with this film is that it goes into the Darwinism/Intelligent Design debate with its mind already made up.  It does recognize that the ID side is a lot better at connecting with people. It attributes this to the fact that they\\'ve gotten slick public relations firms, not that they actually make legitimate points that the Darwinist side is unable to answer.  It does engage in some chicanery. For instance, it attacks Dr. Wells \"Icons of Evolution\" on the dispute over Haeckel\\'s embryos. THe problem is that Haeckel\\'s embryos are frequently included in a lot of textbooks. They engage in misdirection by pointing out they aren\\'t in advanced embryology textbooks. Well, most people aren\\'t going to take advanced embryology, they are going to maybe take High School biology.  It criticizes the ID side for using catchphrases, while repeating catchphrases of the Darwinist side- such as \\'God of the gaps\". It\\'s a clever phrase, but it doesn\\'t really address the problem - that there are some huge gaping holes in Evolutionary theory- how did life evolve from chemicals, why are there so few transitional fossils in the records, how would a complex structure like an eye evolve.  It also engages in \"guilt by association\". The Discovery institute uses the same public relation firm as the Swift Vets who attacked Kerry, that makes them evil. Sorry, the Swift Vets had a legitimate point, Kerry was presenting himself as something he wasn\\'t.  It also presents it as a \"blue state/red state\" issue. Again, wrong. I know a LOT of liberal democrats who believe that God had something to do with the origin of life in the world.  In all, it tries to be fair, but really isn\\'t.',\n",
       " b\"Elfen Lied is probably one of the greatest Anime cartoons ever made till date. It garbs you and pulls you in straight from the first episode and doesn't let go right through to the final thirteenth episode. Its all about how a girl named Lucy escapes from a facility and starts her adventure from the time she becomes her spilt personality/alter ego after a shot to the head Nyu on a rollercoster ride of love, sadness, death, hatred, love and laughs. It has a very gripping storyline and isn't for people who can't stand gore, brutality and cruelty (basically the faint of heart). I've watched all sorts of Anime but none shocked me as most as Elfen Lied and made me use all my emotions to the max. Even if you don't like Anime you have to watch Elfen Lied. It'll give you an entirely different perspective on Anime itself but also life.\",\n",
       " b\"I saw this about 15 years ago when my mother rented it. Why Blockbusters had this in the comedy section, I'll never know. Seniors defending their block of flats against developers at *any* cost. Really creepy, or just bad acting? If you're looking for some _Exorcist_-era horror, it might be worth a look, but only if you've already seen everything else on the shelf.\",\n",
       " b\"I've now seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it I like!  50's US sci-fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch: they were either intelligently made and/or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.  It also had a head start with the script - although Shakespeare might not have recognised it, it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well.  It's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200,000 years before. Along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it, but always do. That love triangle thing...yuk! Disney's cartoonery still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of Galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though!  All in all, with all faults, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.\",\n",
       " b'This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs. I enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.',\n",
       " b\"I loved this film when I was a kid and I know a lot of you have been having difficulty finding a copy. I found this guy online that makes DVD transfers of the film on English dub with menus and everything:  http://8store.8thman.com/ta3.htm  I ordered the import from Japan as well but that doesn't have English subs or dubs. I think these transfers will be true to the childhood experience we remember.  I remember watching this film over and over on a VHS tape when I was little but that tape has long gone and I am aching for a DVD version. Hopefully Sanrio reproduces this classic on DVD because there is definitely a cult following. I've been seeing bootlegs of this going for as much as $70 on eBay!\",\n",
       " b\"Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time \\xc2\\x97 I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise \\xc2\\x97 biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.  The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.  I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines \\xc2\\x97 almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club \\xc2\\x97 a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.  There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole \\xc2\\x97 first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission \\xc2\\x97 the more they're sucked into tragedy.  The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.\",\n",
       " b'This is one very dragging along piece of film. It clearly reconstructs the youth of Hagbard, a young German hacker in the eighties. This film reminds me of so much of my own youth, and August Diehl\\'s (Karl Koch) acting is perfect, that me and my wife now had to see it for the third time.  Read Clifford Stoll\\'s book \"The Cockoo\\'s Egg. Inside the World of Computer Espionage\" to see the movie from the American view. You will understand some scenes better, for example where the number salad comes from on the computer screen in the phone booth.',\n",
       " b\"Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as well.\",\n",
       " b'I wasn\\'t thrilled by this movie, or even vaguely moved. I was  restless and listless and found myself looking at the scenery and  the camera movement, a sure sign that it is not working on any  level. As Emanuel Levy says in his book Cinema of Outsiders, this  film has a \"senseless narrative and flaunts an arrogant style, but  like The Usual Suspects, it\\'s hollow at the center.\" I agree. .',\n",
       " b\"Yes, I've seen worse films but this was so bad they had trouble keeping horses during the shooting; the critters would all run off at night. To say Joe Willie's talents lay elsewhere would be the understatement of the decade. His dismal performance wasn't all that noticeable, however, because everybody else stunk like a week old corpse in a broken icebox during a Texas heat wave. Even Elam, one of my all time faves, couldn't keep a straight face in many of his scenes. There was so much ham in this turkey that if Jimmy Dean bought it he would have to open up a new building to process all the pork. Seldom have I seen a greater collection of grinning jackasses than were displayed in this thinly plotted venture. The soundtrack was interesting but all that rock music never quite dovetailed with the action on the screen.\",\n",
       " b'First, I want to point out that the copy of this film (DVD) that you want is the re-worked UCLA film lab version that was digitized from a very pristine black-and-white 35 mm print. All other copies are inferior to this one. The aspect is full-screen.  In the story, A British courier is dispatched to Washington as a decoy for the real carrier of a secret WW II document which is imperative to the Allied offensive. The real courier is one Alfred Pettibone, traveling under the alias of John Gregson (played by Gerald Hamer, astonishingly, uncredited in this film! We also saw Hamer play the postman in \"Sherlock Holmes and The Scarlet Claw\"; and other characters in \"Sherlock Holmes Faces Death\" ; in \"Pursuit to Algiers,\" and in; \"Terror by Night\").  Pettibone/Gregson manages to surreptitiously hand off the document, which he had reduced to microfilm and embedded in a matchbook, to the fianc\\xc3\\xa9 of an American Navy Lieutenant -- she doesn\\'t know that she has it until she suddenly recalls that Pettibone/Gregson dropped the matchbook into her purse just after he lit her cigarette. Still, she plays dumb to Zucco\\'s threatened tortures. Before the girl\\'s actual abduction, Pettibone/Gregson is kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by these same Nazi agents, (one of whom is played by Daniell).  Holmes and Pettibone had worked together before on important cases so Holmes is ready to take on the task and travel with Watson to Washington when the British authorities tell him that his associate has disappeared, along with the document. Subsequent to attempts on his own life and that of Watson\\'s, the pair travel to America where the Washington D.C. police are at their beck and call.  It\\'s soon discovered by both Holmes and the Nazis that the young fianc\\xc3\\xa9 has the document, or at least a knowledge of its whereabouts, so the bad guys kidnap her just before Holmes can get to her. Then, Holmes has to dredge up some quick clues to locate the Nazi agents\\' (the boss of whom is played by the great and sinister George Zucco!) base of operations.  Will Holmes be in time to save the girl and recover the document?!? What do YOU think *.* Still, it\\'s a good suspenseful film with plenty of action. Definitely worth watching.',\n",
       " b'Django (Franco Nero) has given up his brutal past and spent the last ten years in a monastery. When he is captured by slave traders and learns that one of the kidnapped children is his daughter, he escapes and seeks revenge. This woeful update of the Django series, considered by some the official sequel due to bringing Nero back to the role, is not even a western and doesn\\'t even seem to be set in America! The film is in English and is terribly predictable with Django digging up his fake grave which contains his machine gun coffin and just when all seems lost toward the end, the main villain\\'s (Christopher Connelly) jealous servant sets Django free. Although the film seems proud to be associated with the original Django (1966) going to the trouble of listing - \"Django created by Sergio Corbucci,\" this is a disgrace to the original. Co-starring the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance.',\n",
       " b'Well it is rather bad, but what can one expect from the Afterdark series I have given up on them a long time ago. I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films. This movies are not to graphic for theaters, these movies are to cheaply made and for the most part bad for the theaters. This movie was so boring from the get go I almost fell into a coma during the first hour or so. Then near the end it finally picks up a bit and is tolerable. The story the world is just about gone as we have ran out of gas and this of course would spell the end for people who have to constantly have a phone to their head as you take one convenience away they fall apart. What is left lives here and there sometimes fighting for food and such. Well this roving band of survivors who live in a hospital and pick up a girl whose boyfriend was apparently killed by this one guy who gets away. Well they take the girl back to where they live, in a hospital and you get to see how their boring lives play out. Then a band of cannibals goes on the attack and begins their take down of those living in the hospital. Along the way you get the obvious surprise and a bit of gore, not to much though considering this is a cannibal movie. So you get a movie with most of the action confined to the end and not much of Vinnie or Michael.',\n",
       " b'Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience. An inside look at the staging of \"The Scottish Play\" as actors call \"Macbeth\" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe. With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.',\n",
       " b\"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padm\\xc3\\xa9 and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.  Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.  In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always Lucas' fort\\xc3\\xa9 so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax.   The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.  All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.  8/10\",\n",

Three strangers are hired by a woman by the name of Leah Fuller (Hayward) to rescue her husband (Marlowe) following a mining accident. And now Hooker (Cooper), Fiske (Widmark) and Daly (Mitchell) will all slowly learn about each other and are about to get their loyalty tested. The technical side of this film is about as good as one could hope for. Great color, excellent scenery. A very worth-while watch for fans of classic westerns. Fans of Cooper and/or Widmark also would not be disappointed. If given the chance I would rate it a solid 8.5/10, but an 8/10 on here.',\n",

Typically, a mistake is made by the criminals, and they will pay for it, but they\\'re having fun along the way.

       " b'Yes, that\\'s right. Because my D\\'Onofrio as Det. Goren in L&O:CI was interrupted by an episode of The Contender, which also merits discussion somewhere, I was forced to watch this nonsense. I\\'m fairly certain that if I was given a typewriter with 6 keys and 20 minutes, my script of Locusts would have been better. The general premise is amazing in that bioengineered locusts somehow escape their scientific compound. This leads to an brilliant display of obvious things, namely pregnant women and biblical references. This movie actually contains lines such as: \"I\\'m pregnant and hormonal, now land this \\'copter\". And: \"You did it.\", \"No, we did it.\" I\\'m not sure when I\\'ll be able to keep food down again. Completely unacceptable. The saving grace of this movie came in the commercial breaks, which touted an excellent new Hallmark classic starring Rosie O\\'Donnell and Andie MacDowell, two actresses who have no business in show business. One of them plays a mentally handicapped person and if you can\\'t tell which one it is, then I think that says something about each of their acting abilities. At any rate, Locusts was an offense to good taste everywhere and the film industry has been set back at least a decade. Hollywood really needs to adopt a Xenaphobic policy.',\n",

I was very, very much a Planet of the Apes (POTA) fanatic. I remember learning that POTA was coming to TV and was beside myself with joy. It was the greatest TV event of all time as far as I was concerned. But even at that young age, I was only half way through that first episode when I realized that it was really, really bad. The idea that I was going to be able to have POTA on TV...at home!...was amazing to me. I wanted to like it and was willing to forgive all sorts of junk, but I couldn\\'t do it. I watched each episode, but it really felt like work to sit through. It was just bad, bad mid-70\\'s TV that had people in ape suits. I would compare it to a Starsky and Hutch sort of thing, but that was a much better show!',\n",
       " b'Rock a Doodle is one of the worst cartoon films ever for many reasons.  Firstly it has terrible animation, the animation looks as if it was made at the same time as say \"The Aristocats\" which was made in 1970 and the animation in that looks better than Rock a Doodle\\'s.  Then the characters were annoying with the exception of Chanticleer. The mouse looked so stupid and her lisp was so irritating and the bird had an equally annoying voice and was a pointless character.  Patou the dog looked like one of the typical Don Bluth characters with over-exaggerated mouth movements so when they talk they look as if they\\'re struggling to talk and their lips are stuck together. Phil Harris did his voice well but the narration was overused so much.  Edmund is the most annoying character in the film because the scene where he gets turned from a real human into an animated cat was weird and stupid. Also he was made to try and look cute like Fievel from American Tail but it was so clich\\xc3\\xa9d even down to the over-sized jumper and the voice is even more annoying than Fievel\\'s it makes you hate him.  Then the story of the Grand Owl wanting to make it dark permanently so he could eat the farm animals was stupid. Some of these farm animals are pigs and cows so how can something as small as an owl even dream of eating some of them.  To top it all off the film had really unbearable songs to add to it so overall it is a very bad cartoon. not recommended at all.',\n",
       " b\"THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vall\\xc3\\xa9e of stalwart Julian Fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become England's longest reigning monarch - Victoria. Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not transporting epic.   Grady Harp\",\n",
       " b'\"Kaabee\" depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during WWII, raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for \"thought crime\". This movie was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, most notably the beach scene, is a suspect.  The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible. I am baffled at how they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated still-active actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well. It was Asano Tadanobu though, who delivered the most impressive performance, perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in.  Films with pre-war setting is not my thing, but thanks to wonderful directing and acting, I was totally absorbed by the story. Also, it wasn\\'t a far-left nonsense like \"Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni\", and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.',\n",
       " b\"OK - I bought the DVD because it was only 3.99 in the January sales and because it starred Riki Takeuchi. I feel I was robbed - this film is one of the worst I have ever seen. The actors (I use that word advisedly) are dreadful; the dialogue is sparse and stupid and the film is padded out with endless shots of cars driving past and shots of streets from the driver's point of view. The final showdown is laughable as Riki runs out of bullets and the bad cop doesn't shoot Riki (although he has a loaded gun) and just lets Riki run about 20 yards towards him with a sword and impales him on the front gates. I see from this database that the director Shundo Ohkawa went on to make two other films. How does such lack of talent get to make so many movies? Stay well away from this pile of poo.\",\n",
       " b'Writer-director Neil Jordan (on a roll after the critically-acclaimed \"Mona Lisa\") nearly took his name off the credits of this low-level whimsy, saying the final result had been altered by outsiders. Perhaps they were hoping to find (or save) the center of Jordan\\'s muddled plot, but in the end it\\'s still a wash-out. Jaw-droppingly poor, heavy-handed comedy has tourists in an ancient Irish castle mixing it up with the ghostly apparitions residing there. The cast (including Peter O\\'Toole, Steve Guttenberg, Daryl Hannah, Liam Neeson, Beverly D\\'Angelo and Jennifer Tilly--a highly uneven troupe if there ever was one!) cannot get a grip on their characters and flounder (they should\\'ve threaten to remove their names as well). Romantic and comic shenanigans lands with a big thud. NO STARS from ****',\n",

It\\'s a very good portrait of the so called Belle \\xc3\\x89poque, though Jean Renoir\\'s priorities were always to show a creation, a fantasie. So the film isn\\'t a historical movie.

       " b'Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, gets stranded on a snowy mountain, and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive. Sound familiar anyone? I refer to \"Alive\" from 1993. The only major difference here, of course, is that a big, white, drunken scare crow of a Yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead. I guess humans taste better than yaks.  Stupid: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup.  The plane crash is completely bogus. It would have either exploded in the air, exploded when it hit the ground, or become obliterated. The people would not have survived, but hey, it\\'s sci-fi.  Stupid: They survived, and they are cold. It might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death. Fire being warm as it is...  WTF: The pilot has frost formed all over his face while he\\'s alive and talking, but oddly enough, no one else does.  Stupid: One of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the plane ON FIRE all around them.  Stupid: They find coats and hoodies, and yet there in the cold of the Himalayas, they fail to use the hoods!  Stupid: They\\'re staring at a pile of sticks when, I reiterate, there are pieces of the plane ALREADY BURNING.  Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for its storms. It would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering. There are a lot of pine trees around, the branches of which make excellent insulation.  WTF: When in doubt, use a dead man\\'s arm as a splint.  WTF: If the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears, and leopards in the Himalayas, then why doesn\\'t he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start?   Stupid: When attempting to trap wild animals, mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helps.  WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass?!   WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless. The Yeti ripped out the guy\\'s heart and stomped the girl\\'s head, and the gang did nothing. There\\'s love.  So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever.... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Nice thinking with the javelin and the chain, although this is some ingenuity (with the magically-appearing chain) that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they couldn\\'t even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them.  As is typical for the Sci-Fi Originals, the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them (not to mention they ate human flesh and haven\\'t brushed their teeth in several days).  The very end, however, is quote lame.',\n",

Seriously, what is the filmmaker trying to say? I know she thinks this is cutting edge, but really it is just sick.  And one more thing.

After watching the new \"Inspector Lewis\" (as it is billed here), I am more convinced then ever that I was right...Whately is fine (even though he looks awful (both badly aged and too fat), but he simply doesn\\'t have the charisma to carry the show as did Thaw.  And as for his \"sidekick\" Fox, well...perhaps the reviewers here from England can understand what he\\'s saying, but I for one mostly could not.  As for Ms. Innocent...all I can say is that I miss James Grout.  I\\'m sorry to say that they should have left \"Morse\" rest in peace.',\n",

Skip this movie...it\\'s a waste of time.',\n",
       " b\"This film could probably not have been made in the US without severely damaging the reputation of the producer on the grounds of political incorrectness. Further, my impression is that practically no reviewers recognize what is really going on here. It is about the psychological transformation of a very conservative, and somewhat shy woman, into what in the US we would hypocritically call a slut, i.e., a woman who wants sex and is not averse to using it to make a living as only a woman can. The movie also highlights a key fact about female psychology: nice guys come in last. Of course, women universally deny this, but it is nonetheless true. The only nice guy in the movie, the woman's former boyfriend, doesn't even get sex, he just gets beaten up. Further, the Bad Guy, the guy who forces this woman into prostitution, is in the end precisely the guy she chooses to be with! Sex, which was initially foisted upon a woman who resisted ferociously, effects a transformation. The woman who exists at the beginning of the movie is completely gone at the end, and it is the kind of transformation that can happen only to a woman. The politically correct and highly Christianized society of the West, especially in the US, does not like to acknowledge that women have it in them to change in the manner depicted in the film. It is too threatening to their world view. And that is the greatness of this film: it's honesty about men and women, and an in-your-face courage to face the truth. The story is not perfect, but it is the only one I know of that has the courage to state the truth about these things, and on the whole it's merits greatly outweigh it's flaws. See this movie if you want enlightenment, but be prepared to have your boat rocked if you're the kind of person who prefers to live in a fantasy world of niceness and Christian piety.\",\n",
       " b'**This review is based on the MST3K version of the movie.**  This is a movie about a direction-less, spineless, and unlikable \"hero\" ( or at least the producer\\'s idea of one) named Jodie who drives out to the country to eat his sandwich and meets a farm girl named Melissa. Melissa has a slight problem being that about 120 years ago she sold her soul to Satan and with our \"hero\" Jodie ( a male ) on the job the chances for correcting this problem do not look good. Jodie ends up spending a couple of days with Melissa at her family\\'s walnut farm with her drab family who we do not care for or find interesting except for her old and ugly sister who makes a few appearances to murder people.  The acting is bad but what will really get to you is the SLOW dialog between the two main characters. If you edited out half the gaps between their words the conversation might actually appear to flow normally but since this was not done you are simply left with big gaps where audience members ( the smart ones that is ) will run out of patience and leave the room. It is amazing that the editor left these scenes in; \"Yes, no room for improvement here. Another perfect take HA HA!\" Speaking of amazing, the song \"Amazing Grace\" is featured about half a dozen times toward the end of the film. It would have been interesting to have seen this in the theater to see how much the audience groaned when the song started for the third or fourth time. I am sure that a collective \"Not again !\" drowned out the first measure of the fourth, fifth, and sixth renditions of the song.  About the only good thing about the movie is the woman who plays Melissa. She is most pleasant to look at. You think with a few, make that A LOT of acting lessons, her career could have been salvaged but it was not to be. With the mean-spirited and well-crafted remarks of the Mystery Science Theater gang the viewing experience will be about an 8 1/2. This is one of their best projects. They really tear this movie apart which is exactly what it deserves. Without them I only issue this warning; DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ! YOU WILL BE SORRY ! I GAVE IT A 2 OUT OF 10 AND I MEAN IT !!!  **** SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD****  Our \"hero\" Jodie lets us down right to the end of the film. No surprise that a guy who takes THREE DAY lunch breaks is not a champion overcomer of adversity. Non-Christians will find the ending unclimatic but Christians will probably find it offensive much like I did. Remember, throwing a rock or an empty beer bottle at your television will not hurt those who are responsible for this film so just write a scathing review like I did. God Bless Mike and his robot friends.',\n",
       " b'I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons:   1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: \" I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo \" and \" I\\'ll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle\\'s head in my bed \"   2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won   Last year\\'s award ceremony wasn\\'t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn\\'t the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I\\'m sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers   Chris Rock wasn\\'t too bad , but he\\'s no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the \" minor \" Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There\\'s no such thing as a \" minor \" Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they\\'re as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn\\'t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves   Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category   Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America\\'s greatest living character actors   Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn   Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night   Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he\\'d never won one . Actually I\\'m glad about this because if he didn\\'t deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn\\'t deserve it for THE AVIATOR   Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB\\'s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off   What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven\\'t done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd\\'s sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts',\n",

       " b\"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the AFI Top 100 list (though it's shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, at only #183 as of this writing). If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre (Voight and Hoffman are a superb match), well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you'll love this just as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vivid, always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street, New York City.  The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement (and of the city) and are nothing less than dazzling. I've seen many ideas (including the rapid-fire editing, the handling of the voice-over flashbacks, the drug/trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror) stolen by other filmmakers.  The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it's homosexual underpinnings. I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times, but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether it be sexual or not.  MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film of magnitude, influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on a true American classic. I recommend this film to everyone.  Score: 10 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'\"Dirty\" Harry Callahan(Clint Eastwood) is back on the streets of San Francisco. This time he goes after radical Vietnam Veterans who want to take over.

He gets a new partner which he\\'s not too thrilled to have. A rookie female(Tyne Daly) who happens to be slow at first but has a lot of resilience. In order to get the militants they look up to an all-black group named Uhuru. The leader Mustapha(Albert Popwell), gives out information which is helpful. However, the captain and the mayor captured them, and Callahan tells him where to put his badge. I liked it more when he tells his superior about his \"mouthwash ain\\'t making it!\" What can you say, the captain\\'s a blow-hard, and the mayor is self-absorbed. Both he and his partner go to Alcatraz for the final confrontation, and it took one bazooka shot to stop the leader. This movie was a lot of fun, I liked the part where Callahan took out the crooks at the liquor store, and the last one got his jewels blitzed. This version has more bang for the buck! 5 stars!',\n",

       " b\"This movie felt too natural to be a film. Duvall gave one of the finest performances I have ever seen. His insight into this preacher's soul was amazing and inspiring. This is Americana encapsulated for all to view.  Hollywood would have made it bigger than life, I liked this because it was as small as life. Life is full of sordid details and imperfections. Duvall chose to portray the good with the bad, and enabled movie-goers to experience what comes from powerful stories portrayed by a wonderful supporting cast.  I found John Beasley's performance the strongest I have seen from a supporting character, possibly ever.  If only Hollywood and the movie moguls could make more human stories like this, life would be too sweet. While nothing blew up, this movie had action and power in it.  The story leads in ways I never expected to be led. In the time of high predictability in movies, this one had small surprises, some good, some bad - all very real!  Kudos to Duvall for going that extra mile on his one way trip!\",\n",
       " b'I heard this movie sucked. It did not. It is not great film, but it is good film. The homage to the 1970s was there, the little \"film buff\" touches that remind one of urban horror\\'s roots as far back as nosferatu.  this movie could easily have been a sell out, with Bones as \"Snoop da CROW\"  with the vengeance thing, but it did not.  the only \"bad horror\" gimmick was the last 4 seconds of the film.

       " b'\"Master and Margarita\", the book and the movie:  I have read \"Master and Margarita\" three times, and I am sure that I will read it again. I was very lucky because all three times I read it in Russian, and even the best translation can not compare to the original. Every time, I found something new in the book; it would turn to me by different facets. \"Master and Margarita\" is incredibly beautiful, deep, sophisticated yet playful and sparkling book with unforgettable characters. In fact, it is not one novel but three. First, about the adventures of Devil and his company in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem of the first century, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita. The story of Master and Margarita is the story of Bulgakov and his wife and muse, Elena. All three stories are connected and intertwine. All three of them end with the exactly same phrase, \"...the cruel fifth procurator of Judea, the equestrian Pontius Pilate.\"  So, what is the book about? Good, evil, betrayal, talent, love, forgiveness? Yes, it is. But it is so much more.  I had a lot of doubts before watching the film because as much as I wanted to see \"Master and Margarita\" on the screen I was not sure that it was possible to adapt it and not to lose anything important - which is everything.   I am pleasantly surprised - the film is very good. It is respectful, thoughtful and as close to the spirit of the greatest Russian novel of the last century as possible.  The movie is not perfect (and I don\\'t think that the perfect transfer is possible) but the choice of actors, the music score, the visual palette that change as we enter the different eras, places, and dimensions are outstanding. I was initially surprised by some names but almost every actor proved him/herself very capable in bringing to the screen well known and beloved characters. I would say that some of special effects could be ...well, more special - for example, the mischievous talking cat Behemoth could be done more interestingly. I also don\\'t see the exact reason for creating a new character, the man in uniform with the glasses and very recognizable accent who is in charge of investigating the \"crimes of the band of powerful hypnotists\" - how they call Woland and his entourage. One can argue that the titular couple, the tragic lovers, Master and Margarita are weaker and their story seems pale in the comparison to one of Pilat (bravo to 80 year old stage and screen legend, Kirill Lavrov who can be remembered as Ivan Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov (1969) and Ieshua Ha-Notsri (incredible performance by the young bright star, Sergei Bezrukov of \"Bragada\"\\'s fame, almost unrecognizable as Ieshua). I think no one can deny that Oleg Basilashvili as powerful, cynical and eternally wise Woland, the part of Power \" Which wills forever evil Yet does forever good\" IS the true Master of the film. My fascination and admiration belong to Alexander Abdulov on whom I as a young girl had a huge crush in his early film \"Obyknovennoye Chudo\" . For many years he had been the Russian sex symbol but his enormous comical talent found its match in the part of Woland\\'s assistant/ translator, Koroviev. His and Behemoth\\'s adventures in Moscow are screamingly funny. I think that the film is a successful and enjoyable adaptation of the beloved cult novel and I recommend seeing it. I am going to order the sound track. As I mentioned, the music by Igor Kornelyuk is one of the film\\'s treasures.   P.S. I used to work on the street where the last home of Mikhail Bulgakov was. He was taken to the cemetery from there.  The famous \"Pashkov\\'s House\" with the rotunda on the top where Woland and his team gathered together before they left Moscow forever, was in walking distance from my work, and I remember, once, I almost got hit by the car -I walked and looked at that music in stone and could not take my eyes off it.',\n",
       " b'This is a pretty crazy comedy, divided in 7 segments, all concentrating on different aspects of sex. It\\'s a completely silly, over-the-top done comedy, made in about the same comical style as the early Mel Brooks films. This means that the movie is filled with some crazy characters, hilarious crazy situations and fast jokes, also with its dialog. It\\'s perhaps Allen\\'s most comedy like comedy.  The title might make the movie sound as if it has some educational value but let me tell you, it has none. The situations and characters as portrayed in this movie are way over-the-top for that and basically the only thing the movie offers is some fun entertainment. For instance, one segment is about a giant breast that\\'s on the loose and on a killing spree. Another segment is about a doctor who falls in love with a sheep. This sort of tells you how this movie is like.  Because the movie is divided in 7 totally different segments, the movie has both some great moments and just not as great moments. But anyway, none of the segments are long enough to make you go bored or loose interest just because you don\\'t like one of the segments. And besides, every segments has its fun and at times completely hilarious moments in it to really make you laugh.  Most of the movie is done in one and the same style but some of the segments really differ from the others, such as the Italian segment called \\'Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching Orgasm?\\'. This perhaps doesn\\'t really make \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask\" one of the most consistent movies ever made but I for one don\\'t really mind that all segments differ somewhat from each other. As a matter of fact, while watching this movie I was wondering if the movie wouldn\\'t actually had been an even better one if each segment was being directed by a totally different director, each with their own personal style and approach.  Lot of fine actors show up in this movie. Allen himself plays 4 different roles in 4 of the segments and not always in the lead role. He however lets others play the main role in the others, which works out fine. I think it would had made the movie all the more incoherent when Allen would had played the main lead in all of the different segments. Other actors that really draw your attention in this movie, also because you just don\\'t expect them to see in this movie and in the roles they play (such as Burt Reynolds) are Gene Wilder as the doctor who falls for a sheep and also John Carradine in a crazy scientist role, also no doubt as a fun homage to his horror movies past, from mostly the \\'40\\'s.  A movie you just have to enjoy.  8/10',\n",
       " b\"Mighty Joe Young (1949)  As a movie it's pretty awful, but Harryhausen fans take note  Wow, there sure are some silly moments and bad acting in this movie--and yet I watched it to the end! Why? For the story itself (I love the King Kong idea) and for the campy fun of it. It's actually pretty horrible, and the special effects are interesting if not exactly convincing, so I would recommend not seeing this, actually, unless you are especially into the genre. (Can I put this into somethings a serious as a genre?) The director, Ernest B. Schoedsack, is the very same Schoedsack who directed the original King Kong way back in 1933, but after a series of similar adventure films in the 1930s, he had been inactive for nearly a decade before getting involved here.  The story we've seen before--big ape taken from the jungles of Africa to become a stage act for a impresario of dubious character. The acting is terrible terrible. Say no more there (Robert Armstrong isn't bad). The effects, for all their Ray Harryhausen fame, are pretty basic, though there are a lot of them (the ape, but also lions behind glass, and some mutilation to the lions, beware). Remember this isn't the early 1930s, when the effects for King Kong were pretty amazing in that context. This is post-war America. The fact that everything has to be created by hand and matte shot (double exposed in a selective way) does make it impressive, but even if you like Harryhausen's efforts, the rest of the movie might let you down.\",\n",

I pray that you you all will experience the knowing that they have.Please forgive me if my spelling is not that good,I don't do this normally.Get ready for the truth,it is here.\",\n",

In the meantime a publisher whom he sends the book to rejects it, but later changes his mind when he finds his staff roaring with laughter over Harold's described romantic technique. He releases it as a comedic book and sends him $3000.00. By the way a very funny sequence happens when Lloyd initially thinking it was another rejection letter tears it up and then sees the torn check. Piecing it together like a jigsaw puzzle with his employer at the tailor shop, the zeroes start adding up as his facial expressions change. For that amount of money he'll stand a little humiliation.  Of course the whole idea is a reworking of Merton Of The Movies where the protagonist thinks he's a great dramatic actor, but in fact his scenes are being filmed for comedy. Still why not copy a good thing.  In the end he discovers that his true love Jobyna is about to marry a bigamist. At that point the last half hour is devoted to a madcap chase with the resourceful Lloyd using every means at his disposal to to get him to the church on time and save Jobyna from a fate worse than death. Best scene is him commandeering a streetcar for part of this chase and hanging on to the rod used to connect it to the overhead cable. Lloyd did a lot of these himself, he was known for his daredevil escapades, it's what his fans expected.  Girl Shy is a great example of the comedy of Harold Lloyd who in real life was anything, but Girl Shy.\",\n",
       " b'There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film.  It was straight up trash. At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of FAIL! The fighting is barely martial, the acting is teetering on the edge of par, and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak, and did nothing but frustrate me. I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku.',\n",
       " b\"Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect a movie to adequately convey the rich depth, character and texture of a wonderful and highly entertaining novel. If so, perhaps then this review may be judging the movie too harshly. Nevertheless, as someone who thoroughly enjoyed the book and was looking forward to the movie adaptation, this was a big disappointment The movie adaptation came out approximately seven years after the book was published. To make it more palatable to a modern audience, the scriptwriters have therefore been forced to omit many of the contexts and cultural references contained in the book that made it such a success. This, to me, erases some of the magic of the book -it seemed such an appropriate novel for the times in which it was published and it loses some of its relevance and identity being moved forward into a more modern setting Pia Miranda may be a good actress and, from what I've seen from interviews, a very nice person but she isn't able to give Josie the character depth and dimension that I thought she required. Greta Scacchi's performance as Christina Allibrandi is entirely forgettable and fails to deliver the spark and fiery passion that the same character conveys in the book. Anthony LaPaglia gives a reasonable performance in what must be a difficult role and, if I remember, the respective actor and actress who play John Barton and Katia Allibrandi are also quite good The script and dialogue, so successful in the book, falls flat in this movie. It isn't helped by the fact that the scriptwriters insist on changing the sequence of events in the movie so that they don't make sense like they did in the book. Moving John Barton's suicide from close to the end of the novel to the middle of the movie adaptation makes no sense and serves no purpose, whereas it is evident in the novel why the suicide occurs close to the end. Furthermore part of the success of the novel is it left so many questions in the end unresolved. Why do the scriptwriters feel the need to give everything a happy ending in the movie -i.e. have Jacob meet Katia Allibrandi, have Christina Allibrandi find out her true heritage and the like? Why do the scriptwriters feel that everything has to be spelled out and resolved for the movie audience? This is not a terrible movie, it just falls flat too many times and contains too much unfulfilled potential. Personally I had hoped for much better\",\n",
       " b'The fifth \"Black Emanuelle\" I\\'ve watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her own hometown, New York! The film is peopled with past veterans of the series which, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (appearing here as a head of a United Nations committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as Rassimov\\'s chauffeur).  Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite their being shown in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in \"Stracultr) in which an Asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here!! Still, a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls (including, naturally, Gemser and Shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of bums (this is the way he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact.  The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from Gemser\\'s penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her excursion to India to interview a charlatan/Guru (George Eastman made up to look considerably Christ-like!) who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; of course, when Emanuelle calls him up on it, he ends up having premature ejaculation...!!',\n",

DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE! (F-)\",\n",
       " b\"When HEY ARNOLD! first came on the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE since it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, having nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. Going into the theater, I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens' cartoon like the RECESS movie was. I guess I got what I expected. It was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie was a stinker. Simply for kids.\",\n",
       " b'Make-up maestro Tom Savini\\'s color remake of Romero\\'s 1968 classic follows the original almost shot-by-shot,but it\\'s of course not better film.This remake was clearly made for younger viewers who refuse to watch black-and-white films,no matter how good they may be.The result is passable,but it lacks dark atmosphere and mood of the original.If this version has anything to offer,it is Patricia Tallman(\"Army of Darkness\")in an engaging lead performance as a tough,independent heroine.This is only my opinion,but I\\'m really fed up with \"strong female lead\" concept that every new horror film seems to have.The next thing I dislike in this picture is the lack of gore.For God\\'s sake this film was directed by gore wizard Tom Savini-the man behind such hard-core splatter flicks like \"Maniac\",\"Nightmare\" or \"The Prowler\".The violence is very tame-even by today\\'s standards.However the acting isn\\'t bad,the zombies are pretty scary and the film is never boring.Recommended for horror buffs all around the world.',\n",
       " b\"This film was the reason I became a film maker. Period. It is very inspiring to watch, with superb acting, quiet character building and developing. The film grabs you and pulls you into a small New Mexico town setting. You become completely engrossed with the story and the characters. It takes time to develop personalities within the female leads and the viewer becomes quite vested in their futures. I found Fairuza Balk's acting performance particularly compelling. One of my favorite acted roles in cinema (quality wise). This film is in my top ten favorites of all time, and also my twin has similar affinity for this superb film. Kudos to a film outside of the ordinary with a true independent vision.\",\n",
       " b'\" Irina Palm \" is a curious combination of the British village comedy and raunchy HBO special. The story of a grandmother who resorts to desperate measures to make money for her sick grandson\\'s operation could\\'ve easily been a tearjerker for simpletons. Fortunately that didn\\'t happen. Maggie is a sad ,lonely, middle-aged frump who spent her life just plodding along. Her life\\'s greatest humiliation somehow turned into a hope for better future all around. It would be impossible to tell this highly unusual story without creative actors. Marianne Faithful may not be the greatest actress in the world, but in this part she fits the bill perfectly. Her sultry deep voice and her tired, natural face speak for themselves. Serbian actor Miki Manojlovic plays his role with great flair and charm. This is a small, independent flick that makes us believe in power of brave ideas.',\n",
       " b\"This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene the Marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. Perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.\",\n",
       " b\"Let me state first that I love Westerns & Civil War stories. I also consider John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne & William Holden's acting ability.  I cannot remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it since then.  As per my 4 rating, one can say I did not like the movie.  I now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.  John Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay from Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very gifted writer & wrote many fine scripts, This script is poorly written & badly researched. They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison, At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time.  John Ford was directing films for over 40 years & won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during the making of this.His usual style was missing. It could be that this was film in the south & east and not in Monument Valley.  He normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film, MOST were missing this time. This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles & of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were; sadly missed here.  Now we come to the main stars John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke also must have been ill,he seemed out of place here. This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly, he was just adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he usually was.  It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here in her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, But not really an actress, She is still having roles on Television. Let me be kind and say she has had a long career,more based on her looks than acting talent. Also in caas as Ms. Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson.I am glad she stuck to tennis.  The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films There were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry, not good at all. The action scenes were good but come at the end of film.  Ratings *1/2* (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)\",\n",
       " b\"...as well as a holiday tradition! Kudos to Merv Griffin Enterprises...  Who can not love Melody Parris, the main character? Yet, the main point of the story is how everything came together for her when she decided not to 'wait' for anything anymore. It was only when Melody stopped wishing and actually did something that all the pieces fell into place: like going to that swanky restaurant even though she had no escort, and joining in the fun with the other diners.  Favorite moment: Melody's honest, heartfelt plea to the cops who were about to tow her car away - 'if you take away that car, you will ruin whatever luck I have', or words to that effect. And you know...it worked! Second most favorite moment: Melody dumping dinner in George's lap.  I'll never get tired of watching this one. And, for the record, I still watch 'It's A Wonderful Life', though many have gotten sick of it, sad to say.\",\n",
       " b'I have a certain respect for Rob Zombie. His love of the classic cult grind-house horror of yesteryear is very endearing and I believe him to have a certain integrity rare amongst film personalities. Unfortunately House of 1000 Corpses, while certainly expressing Zombie\\'s love for old school shock horror, is simply too convoluted, elaborate and often boring to send a single shiver up the spine.  It is obvious that painstaking care was taken in the aesthetics of the film but unfortunately it has failed. For the most part the film looks as if the lighting and makeup designers had just come from a job on The Bold and the Beautiful with gaudy colours and super smooth skin on characters who have supposedly been on the road for days detracting greatly from any attempts at a gritty atmosphere. Even in the supposed house of 1000 corpses the production design resembles a piece of theatre more than a disturbing pit of hell and mayhem. I understand the burlesque inspiration here but even with that considered the sets shouldn\\'t look so staged. The special effects makeup also looked more like paper mache than deformed skin, apart from Dr. Satan, who does look very effective but is unfortunately severely underused.  The acting for the most part is excruciating. Sid Haig is fun as always and completely steals the show but apart from him there is not a single character here who the audience will feel strongly for or against simply because they are all 1 dimensional stock standards played in the fashion of a high school drama class. One very disappointing aspect of the performances is that the older members of the sicko family are obviously played by college age kids and the poor makeup and acting is unable to hide this. The dialogue is obviously aiming to be quotable, and is therefore so ludicrously overwritten that it does little but add to the amateur theatricality of the film.  By the time we get to the juicy horror stuff the film takes the action in a completely convoluted direction until the audience no longer cares what this sick family is hiding or what kind of back story there may be. Simplicity is the key stroke to the art of the horror film but obviously Rob Zombie wanted to do away with that trend in House of 1000 Corpses. The same can be said of the cinematography. Negative colourization and crash cuts to grainy newsreel style footage of what is happening in another room are amateur tricks at best and more at home in an MTV music clip. To add insult to injury these tricks are overused to the point of exhaustion.  I watched this film with a friend who I consider a kindred spirit in horror fandom and we both are well watched and researched on the genre. I\\'m sad to say that half way through House of 1000 Corpses our silence could no longer be held and my friend finally had to open the floodgates with \"Ugh, this is so bad!\" Yes, it is. Kudos to your vision Mr. Zombie, but your execution is in dire need of tuning.',\n",
       " b'******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************  So who are these \"Mystery Men?\" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn\\'t keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can\\'t help but love him.  These three spend their nights trying to capture that \\'moment of glory\\' they\\'ve dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.  To bring back that \\'extra magic\\' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a \\'psychofrakulator\\' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein\\'s evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.  Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.  This film really is a cross-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic\\'s short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you\\'d see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds.  This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it isn\\'t a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.  What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.  Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious\\' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.  Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it\\'s a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.  8/10 in my opinion.',\n",
       " b'An absolute waste of time for everyone involved(or should that be implicated), disgracefully boring, terrible in terms of plot, with characters being introduced, not even given a name, and not going anywhere, chubby cops doing Kung Fu, hilarious dialog (\"I\\'m a private dick\") and the worst sin of all, uninspiring fights.  The worst of it is, Eric Lee can actually be quite amusing, see his supporting roles in the first two \\'Ring of Fire\\' movies, but here he proves that a leading man he is not, Gerald Okamura, one of these guys who seems to be a henchman in every martial arts film ever, is wasted as the titular villain with bad makeup.  The story concerns some nonsense about a warrior fighting the master demon, being killed, but not before he cuts off the demon\\'s hand and takes it to a temple where it is stowed away, until the box containing it is displayed at a museum, only to be stolen by Art Camacho(one of the worst directors in the history of history) and all hell breaks loose, with the warrior(possibly reincarnated, it never really says) recruiting the aforementioned chubby cop and \\'Private Dick\\' to help him save the Earth, or space or something, the plot, if you want to call it that, isn\\'t exactly good, or even competent.  A boring, poorly made pile of pish that nobody in their right mind wants to watch.',\n",
       " b\"I have no idea why but I like this movie. There are so many obvious mistakes in it, but the simplicity and sweetness of the story make up for the horrible outfits that Drew Barrymores character, Julia wears. Nothing about her said 1985 to me, the year in which this movie takes place. Robbie's friend, Sammy, wears a jacket identical to what Michael Jackson wore in his Thriller era, and I really think that any guy, (at least over 14) that wore this kind of jacket in 1985 would in no way be cool. And what is with the almost whispered lines? In any scene where Robbie isn't singing his voice is so quiet and low. The acting was terrible, except for Christine Taylor and a few others and Drew Barrymore needs to learn a new accent. Other than these faults I can't help but like this movie.\",\n",
       " b'A failed adaptation of Peter Straub\\'s eerie book \"Julia\", which had a tough time getting released in the States (in the early 1980s, it made the rounds of the Los Angeles art-house circuit under the title \"The Haunting of Julia\", not much of an improvement over \"Full Circle\"). Plot concerns an emotionally fragile woman, still grieving over the choking death of her young daughter, sensing the spirit of a child around her, which may be causing death to her acquaintances. Damp, peculiar treatment doesn\\'t raise chills so much as it does simple confusion. Mia Farrow is well-cast in the lead, but there\\'s hardly any character here for her to play, and all we see is her anguish. Some interesting passages--and a bizarre climax--yet one is inclined to believe the film may have been pared down in post-production...it feels truncated and tampered with. ** from ****',\n",
       " b\"This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's answer to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film stands the test of time quite well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film feature some fine performance from some notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties, with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age, they will end up being responsible adults.  Notable cameos in the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real life brother and sister) who are caught up in an arsonists web. Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film 'The Interpretor'.  Violent Playground features a gun siege in a school, so is unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland / Russia.  I lived in Gerard Gardens where the film was shot (though was not born at the time), and have fond memories of the area. I have recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens which includes extracts from 'Violent Playground', and a small UK film 'Coast to Coast' which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive.  There were some complaints from the residents when the film was released, as the film portrayed the area in a bad light. Time has helped heal those wounds.  A little gem of a film, I would recommend you seek this out\",\n",
       " b\"I have to agree. This certainly has the look of an-early '80's shot-on-video porn film minus the nudity and sex.  Not only is this film hideously bad, I've only seen it available in cheap DVD box sets that force you to compare it to better films. The only reason I have it/watched it was that it came in a set titled SAVAGE SISTERS where it is included along with SISTER STREET FIGHTER (the reason I bought the set), TNT JACKSON, and the GET CHRISTIE LOVE! TV pilot. All those films are far better. Given how cheesy and dated they are should give you an indication of how bad HIGH KICKS is.\",\n",
       " b\"This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name on here and I can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find this funny. Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny. It's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn't care. It was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. I guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be.\",\n",
       " b'Personally, it is one of the best films I have seen over a long time. It is commercial, but has a lot of meaning... there is a message for many, right from lovers... to politicians.  As you must be knowing, making a film, means spending money, and all they look for is to derive back that money. As the saying goes, if one does good, good follows. And so most of the bollywood flicks turn out to be glamour and mimicries.  But here is a bunch of people who require a grand appluase for their hard work, time and money.  I am sure there are more who wish to do good, am sure, watching this film will inspire them.  In this case too, am sure the film is going to succeed well. And I really hope they get the money back, so that more \"MEANING-FULL\" films come up.  I am not commenting on the story, because I guess its already available, am here trying to just share the treasure.  films like this can definitely make the world a better place...  Congrats!!!

I wanted to see street scenes I recognized, so I ordered in pay-per-view for my kids, 10 and 6. They seemed to like it. I didn't recognize a single Hamilton location. Moreover, I couldn't believe how few jokes were in the script, how thin the characters were, how uninspired the plot and the performances. I like Mary Walsh as a CBC satirist and she's created and played some funny newfie characters, but it's obvious that for this movie, she took the cash and handed in a quickly-written piece of doggy doo doo. I think we've seen the last of Bailey. Bow wow!\",\n",
       " b'If Leonard Pinth-Garnell, the Bad Cinema maven from SNL, ever compiled a list of ten examples of \"Truly Bad Cinema,\" this epic would have to be on it. Now, I usually don\\'t consider films like this one to be worthy of mention on a bad-movie list. Normally, I prefer the grand turkeys like \"Conqueror\" and \"Exorcist II.\" Still, Linda Blair is Linda Blair, and it was her starring in it that got it made. So I guess we can blame her for this turkey. The fact that these college-age dudes and babes can suddenly shoot like Green Berets is a variation of Roger Ebert\\'s \"thirty-second genius\" motif. That is where the lead hears the whole plot from somebody in 30 seconds, and immediately knows what to do. In this case, the kids practice shooting for a couple hours, then are ready to do battle with an entire army. My favorite bad moment is when the kidnapped girl is ravaged by one of the enemy soldiers. The Commandante comes along, shoots the soldier, then has HIS way with her. She must have had more Latinos land on her than the Bay of Pigs. My favorite character is the American soldier-of-fortune, played by Richard Lynch. They should have called him Pizza-Face Jones, since a) Lynch\\'s face has more holes in it than the Van Wyck Expressway, not far from where Lynch grew up in Brooklyn and, b) he acts like Harrison Ford on \\'Ludes. There\\'s not much more to say, but if you must see it, try to catch it, unedited, on one of the premium movie channels.

John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight. *Love that woman* Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can\\'t stand the sound of country music].

The whole sequence in which Christopher Reeve turns psycho and ultimately splits into two personas, having a big fight with himself, is the only reason the movie is worth seeing, and most people fail to acknowledge that Reeve actually did some truly good acting here, good enough so that the \"bad Superman\" is convincing and somewhat scary -- especially the scene where he is sitting in a bar, unkempt and unshaven, breaking holes in a mirror behind the bar while flicking peanuts at it (never mind that alcohol is not supposed to have any effect on Superman). Unfortunately, the rest of the film is garbage.  Aside from this, the story is not really about any central idea or concept. Robert Vaughan is just a generic Lex Luthor with a different name -- think about it, he even has a blonde bimbo mistress like Gene Hackman did in the two previous films. What is his grand scheme really all about, and what does he want to achieve? Darned if I know. The climactic sequence with the supercomputer is simply bad. The special effects are not very good in this one. And where is Margot Kidder as Lois Lane? She is largely absent from the film. Although Annette O\\'Toole as Lana Lang is a solid substitute, and in terms of her character at least the film is somewhat faithful to the comics.',\n",
       " b'While rummaging through his father\\'s old stuff, a boy named Troy discovers a map that leads to an ancient civilization. Troy thinks the map may also lead to answers to his father\\'s death. But there are other, darker forces at work. A cult bent on world domination wants to get hold of the map. With the help of a former cult member named Rowsdower, Troy hopes to get to the bottom of the mystery before he ends up like his father.  While I usually pride myself in being able to separate the two, in the case of The Final Sacrifice, it\\'s really difficult to imagine watching the movie without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary. The movie seems to have been tailor made for that type of ridicule and mockery. From Mike Pipper\\'s Yosemite Sam-like voice to the over-weight Canadian guys in black hoods and tank top running through the woods to the nonsensical plot to the cardboard Ziox civilization \\xc2\\x96 it\\'s like shooting fish in a barrel \\xc2\\x96 the riffs just can\\'t miss. I\\'ve probably seen The Final Sacrifice a half-dozen or more times and I\\'m always astounded at the ineptitude of it all. Some things are so bizarre, however, that it leaves me scratching my head in wonderment:   \\xc2\\x95 Zap Rowsdower? Really? You\\'ve got to be joking. The name, the actor, the character motivation \\xc2\\x96 none of it makes the least bit of sense.  \\xc2\\x95 Troy McGreggor? Again, you\\'ve got to be joking? I sincerely doubt you could find a punier or bonier looking guy to play the role. And that incessant whining of the name \"Rowsdower\". It makes me want to slap the guy every time he opens his mouth.  \\xc2\\x95 Plot coincidences. Can you write a plot with more unrealistic and unfathomable plot coincidences? Take the bad guys timing in coming after Troy. The map has been sitting undiscovered in Troy\\'s attic for seven years. That\\'s right \\xc2\\x96 SEVEN years. But the moment Troy discovers the map, the bad guys immediately show up on his doorstep. Yeah, right. Or take Troy\\'s chance meeting of Rowsdower. Of all the trashy, redneck pick-up trucks in Canada, what are the chances Troy would pick one to climb in that just happens to be owned by a former member of the cult that\\'s chasing him? Not very likely.  \\xc2\\x95 Is Canada really that desolate of a place? Troy\\'s aunt\\'s house appears to be in a neighborhood of some sort. Is there no one around to notice that something\\'s amiss when hooded goons take a chainsaw to her front door? Does no one notice a band of thugs chasing Troy on his bike? And why doesn\\'t someone notice the shootout Rowsdower and the cult members have on the highway? Is this kind of activity normal in Canada?   This is too easy and I\\'ve barely scratched the surface. I haven\\'t mentioned the lousy technical aspects of the film, the amateurish acting, the poor special effects, or the ridiculous music score. The Final Sacrifice has it all and none of it is good. Because of some unintentional entertainment value I derive from the film, I can\\'t rate it any lower than a 2/10. But as far as MST3K episodes goes, it makes for one of the best. I\\'ll give that version a 5/5 on my MST3K rating scale. Enjoy.',\n",
       " b'First of all, yes I did see this movie, and no I\\'m not much of a talker when it comes to discussing and reviewing movies. Therefore, I will keep it short and simple.  Nicholas Cage\\'s movies have lately been a lot of action flicks that may or may not seem like movies we\\'ve all seen before. This one, however, brings a new fresh feeling to this genre.  I think we\\'ve all seen the whole \"I see it coming\" type of movie where the main character has to prevent something from happening. This is one of those, and yet it isn\\'t. It doesn\\'t bore you, it doesn\\'t make you feel like you\\'ve seen it before, and yet you have a comfortability with it that intrigues you throughout.  I found myself quite entertained and the movie didn\\'t lose my attention or have me checking my watch. Good direction and acting. Nicholas Cage does a good job.  I believe anyone who sees this movie will enjoy it for what it is. Go see it, it\\'s a fun flick!',\n",

       " b\"This really is a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.\",\n",
       " b'Lovecraft is gothic, provoking, and disturbing. This movie is weird, boring, and the ending is poorly done and laughable. The story is faithful, but the cheesy effects and lack of suspense make it lose any credibility. Compare this movie with \"Blair Witch Project\" or \"Twin Peaks\" and see how suspense is supposed to be done (I would like to see David Lynch do a Lovecraft movie by the way). But maybe this is just one story that should stay in written form? I would recommend this only to the most diehard of Lovecraft fans. Maybe not even then.',\n",
       " b'LOL, I know I stole that line from I love the 70\\'s, but I just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute I started watching The Bad News Bears. Now to the movie, The Bad News Bears is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, I almost died laughing throughout the whole movie. I obviously heard about this movie from the show I love the 70\\'s on VH1, way before the remake with Billy Bob Thorton. It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it, but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it, because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70\\'s.  Buttermaker is a has been baseball player and now an alcoholic, he is given the job of a little league coach for the Bears since no other fathers are taking the job. But he\\'s definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are, well, I guess you could say \"lacking\" in the department of knowing how to play baseball. But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who\\'s mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause. The kids get better in each game, but it\\'s a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him... and he\\'s an alcoholic!   The Bad News Bears is just so funny, Walter Matthau was just too perfect for this role as Buttermaker, he was so believable. I think my favorite Bear was Tanner, because the role could have been over done, but the kid did it just right, not to mention his last line of the film is just classic and fit the movie just right. I loved how the film wasn\\'t your traditional your favorite team is always going to be out of no where champions, this was an awesome comedy that anyone would just fall in love with.  9/10',\n",
       " b'I didn\\'t intend to write a comment on this movie, but when I looked at the comments that are here, I was totally shocked to find so many people saying the movie is \"great.\" I had to post this comment in an effort to balance things out just a little. I can only hope that it\\'s some huge and elaborate practical joke that all these positive comments have been posted. Now, I must admit that I missed the first few minutes of the movie. Perhaps that would\\'ve made a difference. But I really don\\'t think it would! I came in at a point early on, where Anthony Edwards is about to get some sleep, after which the power goes out and he wakes up late. Whatever happened before that may have been the most terrific piece of filmmaking ever, and maybe by missing that I missed the true \"greatness\" of the movie. But I highly doubt it.  Where I came in was, I believe, where the plot really starts. And I understood who was who quite well enough. The movie was a little odd, and quirky right from the start (where I came in,) but not SO odd that I couldn\\'t stick with it. I stayed with the movie just because the concept of the movie was intriguing enough to keep me watching. But as the movie progressed it got weirder and weirder, and the writing got dumber and dumber!  I finally reached the \"point of no return,\" where you finish the movie not because you\\'re enjoying it, but because you\\'ve already invested so much time in it that you figure you might as well finish it off. The movie got increasingly bad all the way to the end. The characters did some of the most infuriatingly stupid things that I think I\\'ve ever seen. And I do mean STUPID. I want to say the acting was bad, but looking back I don\\'t know that that\\'s true. I think the primary actors were putting a lot into it, but the characters were so ridiculous, it made it seem that the acting was bad. Plus there was not enough character development to make some of the situations seem as natural as they maybe could have. So if I had to point to one thing as the reason this movie stinks, it\\'d be the writing. It was totally moronic. The acting by the primary stars wasn\\'t the worst I\\'ve ever seen, but it wasn\\'t great. The acting by every one else...well, let\\'s just say it wasn\\'t GOOD. I don\\'t know if the movie was cheap to make, but I really hope it was, because it really looked it.  The movie was just all around bad. Battlefield Earth would be able to stand next to this one and hold its head up high. And Battlefield Earth was rotten. Again, I can only pray that all these positive comments about this movie are part of some huge prank. The only other way I can imagine that all the positive remarks got here is that the director of the movie is now unemployed and has all day to write and post new ones. Perhaps to trick people into buying the movie, so he can get some money for food. But let me end by WARNING all who have not seen the movie, but have read all the positive comments and are considering buying it: PLEASE, for your own sake, DO NOT buy Miracle Mile! If you feel you must see it, rent it first!! Or heck, wait for it to play on television; if you have to wait forever, you won\\'t be missing anything! TRUST ME!',\n",
       " b'Saturday night, time to catch a DVD. We were pretty much settled on \"Walk The Line\" until we saw this. It had Tom Green, it looked like a \"comedy\" so we went this way. I obviously knew \"Walk The Line\" was slightly more acclaimed, but I was in the mood for something light and easy.  \"Bob the Butler\" is all about Bob (Green), a terrible employee who\\'s tried a stack of jobs with little success. He comes across an ad for a butler course and decides to give it a go. While doing the course he receives a request to babysit (one of his old jobs) and gives it a go. He does well so the mum decides to hire him as the butler. From here we can work out what\\'s going to happen and the plot plays out exactly as you\\'d expect.  Terrible movie, even for the genre. An all over the place, poorly laid out script with Green way out of his comfort zone. It was sad watching him play this role. The kids were OK but that was about it. Don\\'t waste your time.',\n",
       " b\"Even giving it the benefit of the doubt, I can't find too many redeeming qualities in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The plot has become the standard story for the next four decades of horror flicks, the characters are as generic as they can be, the violence isn't even scary nor disturbing...  Horror movies have different ways to scare the audience: the most common are gore (i.e. physical violence/torture) or psychological distress.  TCM fails at both.  The violence is pretty much par for the course, with nothing overly graphic or nauseating.  The psychological aspect is totally absent: it's impossible feeling empathy for the victims, and the murderers are so implausible and cartoonish you almost expect Uncle Fester to show up at dinner table.  Not scary, not unsettling, just grotesque and dull.  I'm aware I can't judge the movie with today's standards, but despite its status of Cult Movie, groundbreaking work etc etc, I just can't bring myself to care much about it.  As scary as this may sound (and it IS scary to say), the glossy and Hollywood-style remake was better. At least it didn't look like an high-school project filmed with grandpa's old 8mm\",\n",
       " b\"I don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but I guess that's what reviews are, personal taste. Missed in this movie was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affecting. Undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs, taboos of the times and classes, race relations not being in a very good state of equality, guilt, yearning, hate, confusion, very dark emotionally I thought, under the skin, you have to submit to the aire of it, a flowing movie, not slow as stated before, release yourself to the flow of the film, the emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their flaws, their nasty insides, excellent and actually very cruel!\",\n",
       " b'Not the best movie I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not the ABSOLUTE worst either. If some actual time had been put into developing the plot, working on the foreshadowing instead of dropping obvious things in places they obviously didn\\'t belong in, if some of the ideas had been dropped to develop the better ones, than it could have been so much more. However, doesn\\'t happen. The whole issue of the Governor is really just unnecessary. Sure he is the reason she had an abortion and there is an attempt at saying \"she\\'s the one because of it\" but that could have been time better spent on the character of Mowatt himself. He\\'s no Hannibal (although they try really hard don\\'t they!) because as horrible as Hannibal Lechter is, you come to care about him a bit. She\\'s no Clarice (again, very uncanny resemblances in the performances) and throwing in some psychic abilities, religious capabilities, doesn\\'t change the fact that it is. I also found myself seeing a bit of Brutal Howell but again, not enough to matter. I didn\\'t even care all that much when the guy dies in the beginning, even though they tell us we should. They don\\'t show us. They don\\'t show us anything except an eclectic mess of ideas and they tell you the important parts. I could see the writer developing his talent and over time doing something great but this one isn\\'t it. That said, I didn\\'t pay to watch it. I caught it late night on a movie channel and it\\'s not so terrible that you wouldn\\'t want to watch it if there wasn\\'t anything else on but it would be a cold day before I\\'d pay any money to own it. It would insult the real movies in my case...',\n",
       " b\"This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, ANYTHING else. At least that's what it was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone: You'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, pick anything else. Even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it.\",\n",
       " b'Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in \"Hot Millions,\" a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It\\'s not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can\\'t keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they\\'re made for each other. Of course, she doesn\\'t know Ustinov is a crook.  This is such a good movie - you can\\'t help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov\\'s machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there\\'s a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don\\'t miss this movie, set in \\'60s London. It\\'s worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, \"I\\'ve been sacked.\"',\n",
       " b'I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is.. A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.  I don\\'t like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. The director firstly presents the material in an extremely \"arrogant\" way and worse, extremely incoherently. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it.  I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn\\'t seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.  Let\\'s compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe\\'s \"Seul contre tous\" to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it\\'s fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.  Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things.... to a POINT. But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say \"Who cares.\" It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.  If you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what I have said of it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.',\n",
       " b'This is full of major spoilers, so beware.  \"Prix de Beaute\" always suffers in comparison to the two films Louise Brooks made with G. W. Pabst, \"Pandora\\'s Box\" and \"Diary of a Lost Girl,\" but in some ways, \"Prix\" is the quintessential Brooks film. Here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her Pabst collaboration. What \"Prix\" has that the Pabst films don\\'t is music. In this early French film, the whole Louise Brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image, song and music. The Charleston is what seems most associated with Brooks (she was the first to dance it in Europe), but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango. The tango also plays a plot point in \"Prix,\" being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming Miss Europe. Later, when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband Andre, the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player. So appropriate is the tango to Brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life, \"Looking for Lulu,\" a film narrated by Shirley Maclaine. The brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes Louise Brooks\\' strong-headed but elegant and erotic individuality.   The song, \"Je n\\'ai qu\\'un amour, c\\'est toi,\" adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film (but a very good one). By the way, Brooks\\' voice was not dubbed for the film by Edith Piaf as some have claimed. Piaf was born in 1915, and wasn\\'t discovered until 1935. The song, however, is what Brooks\\' character, Lucienne, sings to Andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him. And at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test, which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career. It continues on screen after husband Andre, who has followed her to the screening room, shoots and kills her. In a single shot, with Lucinenne\\'s dead body in repose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to Andre, the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized. As Andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen, the murder weapon still smoking, he subtly smiles. She is now his forever, and by association, ours.   Coincidentally, Louise Brooks real life career crashed and burned after \"Prix de Beaute,\" so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well. This film really seals the Brooks mystique more so than the Pabst films (which are superior films, no doubt). It also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the \"cult\" of the movies - where people like Brooks, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive.',\n",
       " b'I felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story. The acting by Nolte, Lee, Arkin and the supporting cast was superb. The strange twists in the Vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details.',\n",
       " b'Fred Astaire\\'s first forays into the Western genre, the TV medium and moustache-sporting came via this modest \"old men\\'s movie\" about a trio of retired Texas Rangers who come together to help their old superior who has been wrongly jailed for robbery and murder. Walter Brennan, Chill Wills and Edgar Buchanan reprise their roles from the original THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG TV-movie made the previous year, while Astaire takes on the role of the troubled Baltimore Kid who might not be in jail or lynched (as newspaperman Andy Devine misinforms them upon their arrival) but has fallen on hard times and become the town drunk instead! The thing is that Astaire is unable to accept his growing old and his shooting abilities not being what they used to so, to build up his confidence once more, the trio convince him to accept the badge of town marshal with them as his deputies! However, Astaire deludes himself further into thinking that the roughnecks who come into town eventually leave it because of his notoriety (rather than through the helpful \\'armed and invisible\\' presence of his friends) and even befriends a much younger saloon gal who turns out to be the girl of the robber behind the crime Astaire was supposed to have committed in the first place! The quintet of Hollywood veterans provide the only pleasure to be had from this meager production because whenever they are offscreen things get pretty dull indeed.',\n",
       " b'This is one of those films that I remember being in the can for years before anything happening w/it. I don\\'t think it\\'s terrible, but it\\'s not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best. The cast is pretty good in what they\\'re given, but again you are only as good as the script. Baldwin directing this although I could have sworn he didn\\'t direct all of it, I thought I read somewhere or lots of re-shoots wasn\\'t bad but he definitely has some potential in there. Although his work on \"30 Rock\" is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer. I just hope the show bows out gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years it went. So if you want to see a film that you won\\'t get much from, but won\\'t really hate either well this is for you. I can\\'t remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on DVD at that. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen \"The Edge.\" Now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment.',\n",
       " b\"Alright, about my rating first: I realize that this movie is not 10/10 quality, for it is a good one, but we have all seen better. However, in it's own category, it shows some qualities, that are rarely seen at cinema.   Namely: Well done sex scenes.  People, seriously, why is it so hard to make them? In most movies you see, they're either toned down and flat, or over the top and out of place. This one's on the other way taking it to the extreme. The whole film is about two young people on a one night stand in a motel room. There are no other actors, and no other set. Just these two, who came to have sex. And to have it as many times as possible. The night is long, and they already paid for the room, so it's perfectly understandable.   The story is about the two getting closer and closer, until their relationship turns from 'total strangers' to 'uncomfortably close, for a one night affair'. And that's another interesting thing about this one. I bet everyone of you has memories of sitting through a movie with a larger audience, coming across an unexpected, kinkier scene, which makes all of you feel embarrassed. Well, this movie doesn't screw around, that's for sure, and maybe because you know what to expect, and because of this film is well written and executed, you'll never once feel that cringe. As a matter of fact, the dialog parts may be much more tense, and uncomfortable. Why? Because a one night affair is not about talking. One might bump into things he or she doesn't want to get involved, or let the other get involved in.   Let's get back to the sex. I really didn't count it, but they're having sex about five times throughout the movie! It's quite a big number for a 85 minutes movie, which tries to tell story actually. But all of them work just fine. It's due to the cast of course, both the actors come off as really likable, good looking, young and fresh, and a strange kind of chemistry is present. As they getting to know each other, slowly, their relationship changes. And here comes another reason why these scenes work so well: good timing and direction. See, it's not just a movie, where these two screw five times and then they talk. The sex scenes are fully integrated into the plot, the have reason to be where they are, and they're executed and played out in a manner that reflects to the actual mood, events and dialog. It means we get about five completely different sex scenes in one movie, on about every significant point of the plot, where they are more than needed.  Deepest regards to the director, for this is truly an accomplishment, not too many could've pulled off.\",\n",
       " b\"this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like Zelah Clarke. i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid. in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.\",\n",

The movie itself is actually quite cool, but \"MST3K\" makes it even cooler. The movie basically has the muscle-bound - and often well-oiled - Greek hero (Steve Reeves) drinking water of forgetfulness and getting seduced by Queen Omphale (Sylvia Lopez). Mostly, it seems like an excuse to show scantily clad women. I guess that even ancient Greece was a male chauvinistic fantasy!   But seriously, the \"MST3K\" version is the one that you gotta see. You can probably guess what sorts of things Joel, Servo and Crow say. Specifically, they sneak in mentions of Uri Geller, Kim Cattrall and Ricky Nelson. How else to keep sane while watching these cheesy flicks sent by Dr. Forrester and TV\\'s Frank?   Yes, you know what Hercules and the queen were doing when not on screen.

Imho their best period overall was with Universal during WW2, but this is on the same level and the generally higher production values more than compensating me for the loss of that special Universal atmosphere. It only came about because MGM wanted to re-use the sets from the film they'd just made of Kismet with Ronald Colman, so John Grant set about writing a pastiche version for the duo.  At Port Inferno in Africa Bud & Lou are travelling magicians Garvey & Johnson but only making a living thanks to the alluring insistence of the top star Marilyn Maxwell; they all get ravelled up in young Prince Ramo's attempts to overthrow the throne of his wicked uncle Nimativ (full of vitamins one supposes). On the way they also get ravelled up in many of A&C's wacky routines including Don't say Tin, a bit of piffle-diffle, the classic Pokomoko sketch, Lou trying to sleep with a mouthful of beard, and my favourite the Hi Mike sketch \\xc2\\x96 poor devil: shot to death twice, once with a knife! Douglas Dumbrille played Nimativ perfectly as a despot with a human side, even wanting to take Maxwell as wife no. 38. Maxwell had a great song with What Does It Take, while Jimmy Dorsey and his Orch. unfortunately dressed as Arab tribesmen had a couple of interesting well staged and photographed numbers. I wonder if the scenes would have been condemned by todays professional critics if someone like Louis Armstrong (and his Orch.) had been ridiculously togged up thus instead of Dorsey?  For the fan there are many entertaining scenes, some snappy smart ass dialogue going on and the film is a toe-curling pleasure from start to finish; please refer to commenter no. 1 from 2000 if you're not a fan and have as much time to kill as he did.\",\n",
       " b'John Hurt has plays so many roles it is difficult which he personally would select as his best. For Me, I\\'ve seen him play mad emperors, tyrant Dictators and pleasant storytellers all with the same conviction of a true Thespian. In this film \" The Outlander \" his role is relegated to playing the courageous Rothgar, the Danish Chiefton of the Northland Vikings. From out in the distant galaxies and far from his own home world, comes \\'Kainan\\' a space traveler (James Caviezel) who\\'s spacecraft has been damaged and sent careening towards Earth. Upon crashing, he discovers he is on \\'Old Earth\\' circa 10th century, Norway. Unfortunately, he quickly ascertains one of the creatures he was battling in space has joined him when he lands. Here he must not only adapt to the Viking way of life, but hunt down and destroy the last of a race of creatures called the \\'Moorwen.\\' Sophia Myles plays Freya, the chieftain\\'s strong willed daughter and Wulfric (Jack Huston) the brave heir apparent. Ron Perlman is Gunnar and displays some excellent acting as does young Bailey Maughan who is Erick. The movie is a surprising blend of Alien, the 13th warrior and Beowulf. The dramatic action theme is way above par, while the physical confrontational scenes and special effects are incredible. A superb movie and a worthwhile entry on it\\'s way to becoming a memorable Classic. Highly recommended for all! ****',\n",
       " b\"Using the life of Mark 'Gator' Ragowski as the thread, director Helen Stickler tracks the rise of skateboarding from underground pastime to cultural phenomenon. As corporate America jumped all over the sport, the proponents got richer and the sport of skateboarding more mainstream, but some of the players weren't equipped for the fame and money - Gator amongst them.  With a great soundtrack, excellent original resources and unparralleled access to the sports biggest names (many of whom skated with Gator and are now owners of Skateboard companies), Stoked is as much a look at the Eighties and the gluttony of the times; some made it through unscathed, some profited nicely, and one at least is going to be in jail for some time to come!  Stoked is a great documentary, for fans of skateboarding and pop culture junkies alike\",\n",
       " b\"I don't know who is really to blame for this totally uninteresting, formulaic, unmoving film.  By watching the Project Greenlight series, you can see that nobody knew exactly what type of movie they were making. From Erica Beeney, to Kyle and Efram, Chris Moore, none of the Mirimax studio executives.   There does not seem to even be the potential of a good story in this movie. At least nothing that hasn't been seen over and over again.  This is what happens when too many people get involved in the development of a script. This is just a mess.  I wish I could say that the acting made this film better, but it doesn't.  A waste of one million dollars.  3 out of 10\",\n",
       " b\"Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her.  I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although short. Some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done.  This is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. The humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile.  There is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action movies. Asides from it's little plot, the weak drama and bits of comedy antics, the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action. Kept me entertained from beginning until the end. I thought Shannon Lee was awesome in the movie.  Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps Hong Kong action going strong. This modern action film is highly recommended!!\",\n",
       " b\"This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.  The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.  The clich\\xc3\\xa8s are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.  This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.  I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.\",\n",
       " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs   In the future, all is kept fine and dandy by a group of men and women called The United Federation of Planets. But when some dastardly fellows take over a space-ship to enforce a gold deal, some fellows called the Space Marines are called in to sort them out.  This is a far glossier presentation than Talaat Captan's earlier work such as Digital Man and A.P.E.X., but it's still glaringly low budget. It all basically just feels like Under Siege in outer space (even the spaceship is named the Missouri as in Under Siege!) In fact, there are weird scene references through-out to that particular film that left me with the impression that the writer had some special kind of liking towards it. Aside from that, it's just the usual collection of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that are typical of a straight-to-video work such as this. Not to mention some really bad acting, from the token black guy to the lead bad guy who seems to think he's in some production of Hamlet at the local rep as opposed to such a flimsy piece of work as this. Glossier and more violent, certainly, but definitely not as enjoyable as Captan's earlier work. **\",\n",

There wasn\\'t even a mention of where they are today or why they didn\\'t participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.  Anyway, I was glad that TNN ran the series again! I had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan',\n",
       " b'Unfortunately this movie tries too hard to be a poor man\\'s Coen brothers movie but doesn\\'t hold a candle and goes nowhere. The low budget does not make up for an inadequate script that feels too much like an attempt to put as many oddball characters into this short movie as possible.  The story is about an estranged family going to visit their daughter/sister in New York and each is dreading the encounter because of all the past trauma. We don\\'t really know too much about the past because it\\'s only dealt with on a surface level and too many attempts at funny moments preoccupy the running time of this film. Katie Holmes plays the protagonist, a somewhat clueless bittersweet girl who needs to find a way to cook a reasonably good Thanksgiving dinner and hopefully to get her Turkey done in time to meet the family. Thus begins the long crazy nutty quest that will end when the twain shall meet.  This isn\\'t to say that this movie doesn\\'t have its moments. It really does have very good parts but it is as though the writer/director missed the boat entirely in spending so much time on the build-up and the climax ended far too quickly. Unfortunately the build-up is a bunch of comic moments with attempts at sweet humanity and a whole lot of obvious moments where the movie is merely a script where events just don\\'t happen and people don\\'t act a certain way. It\\'s not natural. Like the Coen Brothers this film is all about the characters but unlike the Coen Brothers there is precious little real effort made to make sure that the characters act, say and do what the real characters would. Instead, the writing and direction goes more for over the top humor and an attempt at one punchline.  This film had a lot of promise. Some very good moments and Holmes does shine in her part, which actually doesn\\'t delve very deep but saves the film. Most of the comments here are unfortunately shallow, the same people who just want a good Hollywood like feelgood movie with shallow \"depth.\" The ending is predictable, preposterous and unfortunately resolves nothing and is a mere cheap tug at the heart strings which suckered in most of the reviewers here with \"style\" that isn\\'t impressive. And they lived happily ever after. It\\'s too bad this movie is completely forgettable and an opportunity missed.',\n",
       " b'Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It\\'s chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I\\'ll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn\\'t help but feel like I was watching \"Coffee Talk\" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he\\'s ready to make another Austin Powers movie.

EPIC MOVIE (about as epic as a kindergarten play), is and I\\'m going to emphasize it as hard as I possibly could a horrible, horrible, HORRRIBLE movie. I actually got a headache watching this piece of crap. It makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like POLTERGEIST, JAWS, PSYCHO and THE SHINING\\'S greatness combined.  None of that hasn\\'t bee said before. But let me tell you this film is about as funny as a funeral. No worse, as funny as going to prison. The film tries to rely on it\\'s \"jokes\", which are no better then fart and poop jokes. My 5-year old cousin could\\'ve wrote a better script.  so, in another words, only watch this if someone else\\'s life in is danger.',\n",
       " b\"This show is beautifully done. When it first came out I though it nothing more than a light-hearted family comedy with quite a few good one-liners. It seemed to express many families really well too, with different concepts of both parent and child, however, like I said, I never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening. However, my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter accrued. The programme stood it's ground and really commended the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire res of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything. When the show aired after Ritters passing, I really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought this shone threw the acting talents of the three children, particularly that of Bridget's character, who was worried of the last words she said to him. It reminded me that no matter what horrible things I say to my dad, I don't mean them and it's very important that he knows this. Great Show\",\n",
       " b\"A man steps out of an apartment block and is accosted by a vagrant who pulls out a gun and politely requests for a dollar to buy a cup of coffee. The man refuses saying he is feeling manipulated and the vagrant promptly shoots himself. Yes, kills himself! This is the stunningly surreal opening sequence of the film. This stop motion animation film is populated with more such oddballs. . There is a drug addict who has for his buddies three Lilliputians straight out of Gulliver's World. We have a supermodel who likes her men so smooth that she can tolerate neither hair nor bones on their body. There is a little kid who gets a coin every time he drinks milk, which he saves in a piggybank; yet when it gets full does not have the heart to break it.  The one common thread that binds these disparate characters staying in the same apartment block is their deep melancholy. They are bored by the monotony of their lives and are in search of a meaning. We can readily empathise with these characters despite the comic book feel of the film.  The film takes a dig at the self help books available for $9.99. Despite shot in vivid colours, this is a grim film asking some uncomfortable questions about the meaning of life and happiness. The film ends on a positive note though with two of its characters teaching themselves to swim like a dolphin from a self help book. They have managed to discover their happiness. A fairy tale for today's grown-ups.  The animation is a treat for the eyes\",\n",
       " b'I\\'ve just watched this film and I have to say it was downright bizarre. Not the plot - I like fantasy stories and will try to get hold of a copy of Susan Cooper\\'s book now I\\'ve read such great things about it on here. No, it was something else that ruined the film for me; the sense of it being totally disembodied. And it wasn\\'t just about the director having parachuted an American family in to please US audiences.  At one point I turned to one of my companions and said \"that\\'s the most un-English of English villages I\\'ve ever seen.\" Given that I live in an English village, I kind of know what it should have looked like.  Watching the credits, it all became clear: the film was made in Romanian. Note to film making people: Romania looks nothing like England. Not one bit. One of my friends almost guessed it during an ariel shot of the \\'village\\' when she said \"it looks a bit German doesn\\'t it?\" It seems picky but it\\'s one example of how the character of the novel was sucked out of the film. I\\'d sat and watched the DVD of 28 Days Later the previous night: now that\\'s a film not afraid to be British that still went down a storm in the States. It can be done.',\n",
       " b\"The title serves as the antithesis of this movie's existence. It features a deep exploration into the depths of man's focus on racial division as a means of control. It walks the very divide that is inherent to any human; the divide we're genetically predisposed to establishing. What I witnessed was an atypical artistic melding of man and acceptance, forging a deep bond with the essence of equality; no racism, no anti-racism. I cannot adequately explain the premise without ruining the genius that is this movie, so I can't say much more than that! I can truly say that my life changed as a result of watching this film -- heck, it even proffered some hearty laughs along the way!  Don't let the title fool you, it's something the whole family should see!   10/10 - Christopher Poole\",\n",
       " b\"Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie. For some of the names in the cast, I'd expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students, they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. I mean, I've fenced, it's a fun sport, but I've never been that intense. The only reason I even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.\",\n",
       " b'I love this documentary because it gives a better image of who Bruce really was and how much of a great hard worker and perfectionist he was. The only thing that kills me about this documentary is when they talk about the tv series Kung fu. Everybody and their momma know that Bruce should have been playing that role instead of that worthless Carradine. This shows you what type of world we live in. But anyway, I loved the Game of Death footage because of the offbeat comedy between Bruce and his buddies. I liked the way in which Bruce is relaxed and how his buddies sit back and watch him save the day. I really appreciated the lost footage especially compared to that sorry crap they put together back in 1978. Robert Clouse should have his ass kicked for making that garbage. Overall I highly recommend for everyone especially Bruce fans like myself. 4.5 out of 5.',\n",

Obviously, some people enjoyed this movie based on the score it received, but I found this movie very disappointing.',\n",
       " b'This was perhaps the first movie in a long time that I was truly disappointed in. The premise could have been interesting. However, no one really tried... the directing is sloppy, the writing is tired, and the acting is just horrible. Matt Lerner does not make a good leading man and you can definitely see it in the interview scenes. The movie doesn\\'t really capture any sort of idea; the idea of being closeted, of being political, not getting along with your parents, etc. I could go on. None of the characters are relatable, save perhaps an amazing performance by Karen Allen (from \\'Raiders of the Lost Ark\\' fame) who does an amazing job of being a republican senator\\'s wife who basically hates everything about it, especially giving up her individuality. \"Poster Boy\" tries to hard to not be a gay movie; and when you take that away, it really isn\\'t anything else. The first movie I got from Netflix that I probably would never watch again.',\n",

       " b\"I thought the film could be a bit more complex,in a psychological sense perhaps, but the action and voice acting were top notch. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good ones at that. This is one of the Batman Returns/Forever type films, which include romances and the conflicts of Wayne and motives for dating. 007 fans would love this, and so would the females, great theme song! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film, and the Penquin was back to his true form, no mutant genes in him this time! I liked the fact Robin wasn't used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, somewhat of an Indigo child or mind of the future.  The supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars, decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film.  I rate this below Phantasm, Return of the Joker, and Batman vs. Dracula, but liked the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero. 7/10\",\n",

The plot was cleverly put together, and the responses from the characters were quite realistic, making this movie an exciting and thrilling ride (too bad about the give away scene about 3 quarters of the way through.)  The film starts with with the \"putting together\" of a group of ten people, all driven to the same hotel, by a wild storm, that has flooded all the surrounding roads. As time goes by the group of people are being murdered, one person at a time. As you could expect in a situation like this, fingers are pointing all over the place, but who is the real murderer?

       " b'Promiscuous college girls, who remain at their school for the Christmas holiday, coerce their resident cook to go to bed, awaiting gleefully for their boyfriends to arrive by plane(..one of the boys has a rich daddy)so they can gather together and enjoy a night of naughty debauchery, not knowing that a psycho in Santa costume plans to ruin the festivities.  The film opens with a game that ends disappointingly as one of the female students falls off of a balcony, stoned, falling to the ground below..it seems this unfortunate incident might just be the root cause of the Christmas slayer\\'s mayhem.  There\\'s a nerd who talks about the advances in medical science with great detail, some wannabe lothario with an acoustic guitar, an obvious nympho who doesn\\'t get a chance to bed her man, a virginal blonde with a soft voice the gardener wishes to protect, a couple of practical jokers(often criticizing the blonde girl and anyone else they find annoying or bothersome, these two girls are the kind you see in school whispering to each other about people they don\\'t like), etc. As usual, the medical nerd is uneasy about making a move on the girl(..she\\'s this lovely gal with a great body who is practically throwing herself at him, yet, as often was the case, he\\'s too nervous, or focused on his studies, to get a clue). There\\'s a funny scene where our \\'final girl\\' is drinking her milk and listening to the moans of passion from another room! The gardener is one of those old religious kooks dispelling doom to Nancy, the pretty innocent he wishes to protect(\"There\\'s something wrong, I feel it.\"). Nancy spends time skulking about being lonely, until her and nerd Alex(..having lost his virginity with one of the girls, Melody)hook up, forming amateur detectives, and searching out the place in the dark.  One of the funniest scenes, to me anyway, has a naked Leia, who had just bedded one of the cops assigned to protect them, finding the severed head of her pal stuck on the shower head! I was amused as I watched this flick how characters are blunt and honest about others giggling and insulting them while they are still in the room(..such as gardener Ralph who seems to be the butt of everyone\\'s jokes, even though he moves about, saying little, without really warranting such constant ridicule, despite the fact that he\\'s a wee bit creepy).  To All a Good Night is what it is, a prototypical slasher which doesn\\'t distinguish itself from the others of it\\'s ilk. The cast of characters have little personality and will probably not appeal to the masses who look for obscure slasher fare, and when they die you could care less or feel little pity.   Jennifer Runyon is Nancy, Forrest Swanson(Alex), Linda Gentile(Melody), William Lauer(..as TJ, the rich jock with the plane), and Judith Bridges(..whose Leia goes bonkers, singing to herself a lullaby as she dances around in her own little world after discovering the decapitated head and killer Santa with a butcher knife)round out some of the cast in trouble of being chop suey. Sam Shamshak is Chief of Police, Polansky and Katherine Herrington is cook Mrs. Jensen, both of which have pivotal parts of importance as the film unfolds. Buck West is the weirdo gardener. Neither cult star David Hess\\' direction nor Alex Rebar\\'s writing seem very inspired(..it feels like the cash-in of a fad, with little spirit or innovation), although the concept of a killer dressed as Santa was somewhat fresh at this time. I guess the most memorable murder sequence will be when Santa starts up the plane while a pilot is working on the engine, the spinning propeller blade chopping him and a female student to pieces. Something to think about..it seems impossible that one Santa can be at two places at one time, even in the wonderful land of movie time where a killer can move at warp speed.',\n",

       " b'To most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon\\'s brilliant Gothic horror story A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong), and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong), who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy Victorian-style mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with the older Soo-mi obsessively protecting the younger Soo-yeon against danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother\\'s death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality.  While we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings, doors that open and close on their own, a cruel and overbearing stepmother, and other events of high strangeness, A Tale of Two Sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says \"Do you know what\\'s really scary? You want to forget something. Totally wipe it off your mind. But you never can. It can\\'t go away, you see. And... and it follows you around like a ghost.\" There is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel. The plot cannot be summarized, only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective.  In the film\\'s opening, Soo-mi, an obviously disturbed young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened \"that day\", the film flashes back to when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really hurting. As the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences.  Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from photographs, and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity. While we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone\\'s mind, we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the film\\'s second half.  Shot in gorgeous low-light cinematography, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares, and there are plenty. It is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to. While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light, it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness. In the words of a wise observer, \"Blame is never the answer - whether it is blaming yourself or others. Rather, the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely - both of yourself AND others. Forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing.\"',\n",
       " b'AWFUL wot more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in the memory)as a 16 yr old lad. Mark Hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn\\'t great at that, he was worse in this. Plus a dour soundtrack by Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema Arthur 2 on the rocks. Funny how that question \"What is the worst film you have ever seen is?\" is easier than \"what is the best film?\" which incidentally varies between The Italian Job (original), Untouchables, Casino, Things to Do in Denver, Goodfellas (getting a sense of what I like??? - this will fool you!) Finding Nemo, Pirates of The Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please Never Watch this film or it will stick in your memory too!',\n",
       " b\"I have to preface this by saying that I LOVE watching bad movies that are entertaining. This movie delivers 100%. It is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. It is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) that doesn't tie into anything. Then there are the overly long 'sex scenes.' These involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each other's bodies. These are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called 'barely legal' girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this movie, if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue. Then there's Mr Creepo. He throws Ed Wood's name around like he can somehow compare, but he is far far from anything of that quality. He walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on. We couldn't stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified)  I give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.\",\n",
       " b'Paha maa is different Finnish film. But the things which makes it different are copied abroad. Some techniques of narration are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Scenes are shot from different angles again. Paha maa is a good movie, but it isn\\'t so good that the hype tolds: \"Realistic movie, no happy end, and no commercial admissions.\" Some actors did great job. Sulevi Peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. Also Jasper P\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4kk\\xc3\\xb6nen shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He is so overrated actor, he\\'s handsome and a nice guy, but not the best actor of Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, Paha maa is worth to see.',\n",
       " b'when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked. I think that only made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert',\n",
       " b\"Recap: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American Congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in USA's covert war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union.  Comments: A rather funny movie about not so funny things, especially since they were real. But focusing on the movie, Hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing Congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the entire movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman especially, has a rather humorous tone. So much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But, the story that it tell, and maybe the ending the most, are serious indeed.  A story of what happened with some questions about what might have been. So the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want that. Something for everybody? 7/10\",\n",
       " b'I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew \"stoners.\" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that GenXers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co were sort of a strange post-modern anthem for us. Strange because like Beavis & Co we didn\\'t care if we had an anthem. It was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful.',\n",

       " b'Most of the silent films I\\'ve seen have been serious in nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The setting and some of the scenes for \"The Beloved Rogue\" were reminiscent of 1923\\'s \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" relative to the Paris street scenes and the celebration of the \\'King of Fools\\'. John Barrymore portrays France\\'s greatest poet Francois Villon in a characterization that ranges quite broadly from virtual slapstick to romantically tender; that \\'water into wine\\' bit early in the picture was rather amusing.  It seems that times never change, and it\\'s interesting to see the movie make a cogent observation nearly a century ago - Paris has it\\'s fool to reign for one night, while everywhere else has one all the time. How true.  The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, I\\'ve only seen him as Major Strasser in \"Casablanca\", oddly one of his very last movies. As King Louis XI, he\\'s a monarch obsessed with astrology, crafty but suspicious, and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he resembled Brad Dourif\\'s Wormtounge character from the final chapter of the \\'Lord Of The Rings\\' trilogy. Not exactly exuding the confidence a King of France might be expected to bear. Which is why the ascendancy of Burgundy\\'s duke (Lawson Butt) seemed all the more plausible, until Villon rises to the occasion to put one over on both rulers.  I found it interesting that the use of inter-title cards was exceedingly spare, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them though, one would have missed a curious nugget. It seems Villon carried out his exile from Paris at the Hostel of the Lame Flea!   The print I viewed was of exceptional quality, the very first film presented in a one hundred Action and Suspense movie DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment, that\\'s saying something for a film that\\'s now eighty years old. It\\'s great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers.  One question - did it seem like Conrad Veidt\\'s King Louis picked his nose on purpose, or as an inadvertent gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room?',\n",
       " b'This is another of Eastwood\\'s many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with \"The Gauntlet,\" \"Firefox,\" and so forth. Clint\\'s acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, he\\'s taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it\\'s above average.   Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself \"Booth,\" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. And he does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He\\'s tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grasping Booth\\'s hand, and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. \"If I\\'d have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me.\" It\\'s underplayed, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and his lip trembles. It\\'s one of the few scenes in any of Clint\\'s films that might properly be called \"moving.\" We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn\\'t like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they \"carved a nation out of the wilderness.\" Didn\\'t they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)  It\\'s often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It isn\\'t true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous.  Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but he\\'s fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House aid, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint\\'s acting range is limited, Thompson\\'s is something less. In every film he\\'s been in, he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder.  The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in \"Das Boot,\" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, \"Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.\"  Well written and worth watching.',\n",
       " b'The 70s were without a doubt the golden age of \"made-for-TV\" horror. This is one of those that was probably churned out as an ABC movie of the week. It\\'s the old story of a house and/or ghost possessing one of the new owners. The movie has promise, but it\\'s never realized. Everything is rushed too much. Tension and suspense need time to build and grow. And there\\'s nothing new. We\\'ve seen it all before and one better.  One final thought: I don\\'t understand why Robert Wagner\\'s character would fall for the long dead movie star when he\\'s married to Kate Jackson for goodness sake!!!',\n",
       " b'\"Tragic Hero\" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. Also, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time.  One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable. The audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors\\' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness. As a result, we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don\\'t particularly care what occurs with these characters.  Another reason is its lack of focus. The narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film, but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency. The audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing, not knowing what the character\\'s motivations are.  The film\\'s climax does contain a decent gun fight, but again since we don\\'t care about the characters, we don\\'t care who lives or who dies; The scene loses it\\'s intensity and suspense because of this. The other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature, with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing.  In general, this is a strictly average film and isn\\'t recommended to the general film viewer... Only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of Chow Yun Fat should consider this film for viewing.',\n",
       " b'I recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is Chuck Norris. This meant that I would have to do extensive Chuck research, and find out as much as I could about the man. I later find out that he is not in fact a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face like that, who could ever doubt it? I have watched more Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than any one person should. I am proud to say that Bells of Innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list. I spent most of the film wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt, which I had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue. The biggest reason why I chose to purchase this film was that it not only had Chuck in it, but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip off the old can\\'t-act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block. I came to the conclusion a long while ago; the Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason. The only character he ever plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, no matter what situation, he is always Chuck Norris. The one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn\\'t seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems to be extremely happy! Maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic, as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the film, making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was. The other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of Norris. The guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the Direct-to-Video screen. The only thing I remember him being in other than this movie, was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes this guy something. The other guy, which is the only name I can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average Christian fanatic. I don\\'t have anything against Christians, in fact I am one, but this guy was just too much for me. To round out the story, you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people \"friend\", and a couple of villains who don\\'t seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge. Not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies. All in all, the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than Chuck Norris can kick people\\'s asses. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I still can\\'t get enough of Chuck. Maybe he really was sent from heaven...',\n",
       " b\"Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. This version was pleasant but bland.  The love between Mario and Martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. The therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. I liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. I have Mostly Martha at home. Every now and then I revisit it.\",\n",

To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel risks his career and life by giving the spunky lad some hands on aid. They not only don't make Colonels like this anymore, but they never did. This sappy, corny film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a MIG.\",\n",

       " b\"ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80's that deserves an audience that I fear it will never get, and that's a damn shame. I have seen this film compared to others that have gotten a bigger name over the years, most notably PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a much different film than those and I don't see the comparisons other than the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to the one in PHANTASM, but not enough to make any real comparisons. I'm not sure how this one slipped through without a broader acceptance. Maybe it's all in the marketing, I don't know. Perhaps a remake would breathe new life into it, unless Raymar drained all the life out of it that is. I'm not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days, but I think they do work well with lesser known films (except for the awful GHOST SHIP remake, which other than the opening scene and Mudvayne's Not Falling blaring, was utter crap). So if a remake of ONE DARK NIGHT would happen to fall into the right hands, I think it would make a lot of people go and watch the original. I know that's what I do if there's a remake of a film I haven't seen before. So anything short of a remake, I fear, would not bring this film back to life. Unless, of course, Raymar got his eyes on it.  Anyways, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fans, especially 80's horror fans ('cause we all know that's when the best horror movies were made). Creepy setting. Fairly good acting. Very good story. Campy. What more could you want from an early 80's horror film? What's that... nudity and gore? Well, sorry. No nudity or gore in this film, but it's still great nonetheless! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.\",\n",
       " b'Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can\\'t believe it was directed by Wajda. There\\'s practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.  Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of \"personal immediacy\" but there\\'s nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie. Instead, the constant jerking of the camera made me seasick. To be fair, there are some great shots too (no pun intended), but nothing that makes you go \"Wow!\".  If you\\'re not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie will leave you scratching your head. If you are familiar, you\\'ll be scratching your head too, although maybe for different reasons. Basically, the movie states and restates over and over again that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point is hammered repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact. However, the movie never tries to explain as to WHY they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in the other Soviet POW camps were not harmed and were released in 1941. It is also never explained adequately HOW MANY people perished, although the figure 20,000 is thrown in a couple of times.  The acting is adequate with only Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Lt. Jerzy) giving noticeable performances, but they get to act for maybe 10-15 minutes in total. Certainly not enough to carry the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matin\\xc3\\xa9e looks rather than their acting abilities, but I won\\'t mention their names. Suffice to say that they are definitely NOT the Oscar material, so any claims that this movie was \"robbed\" of the Academy Award are simply laughable.  The tone of movie is wrong as well. On one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama, on the other it resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda such as showing a Russian soldier tear up the Polish flag and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot, such as a couple climbing on a roof or the liquidation of the Krakow University.  There are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting, such as adding a political angle to the story, or showing the German discovery of the graves, or even portraying Anna\\'s trip from the Soviet occupied part to the German occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie, but instead they\\'re reduced to a couple of minutes. In the end, we get a collection of loosely fitting, confusing, boring scenes about the reaction of Poles to one of their greatest tragedies of WWII. Not very compelling and not worthy of Wajda at all.',\n",
       " b'This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well up to his excellent standard. It is crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for instance, \\xc2\\xa315 of his last \\xc2\\xa320 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names George), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of lucre, irreverent in the politest possible way, and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde, played with her typical svelte, narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups, and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman, anyway. The romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced Loretta Young, who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. It is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot barely matters, as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. This is just such fun.',\n",
       " b'SPOILER WARNING  I got this dino-documentarie on DVD at Christmas 2004. I had longed to see it and was by no means disappointed. The score is memorable ( my  favourites were the \"Sauropod\" theme song and the \"Winters Coming\" song ). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something too ; Stegosaurs MAY have been able to pump their plates with blood. Female T-Rexes MIGHT have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs. I know there\\'s a lot of people who thought this was based too much on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess at. And there is a lot of hard-core, undeniable FACT as well. We KNOW that some dinosaurs travelled in herds, we KNOW that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind up vegetation in their stomaches. Despite this \"speculation\" the series did extremely well. So well in fact, that it spawned a followup, a prequel and several specials. If you\\'re a dino-fan, then this IS for you. It makes Jurassic Park look small and weedy.',\n",
       " b\"There is not much of a plot to this movie. There is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for neglience. Not much more than that, but .... IT DOES NOT MATTER!  It does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life, and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not cracking up laughing, you have a smile on your face.   Matthau plays Charley, whose wife recently passed away, and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital. He is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who, at first, is a patient in the hospital (their first scene together is very funny) and then they meet up again on a television panel discussion show, where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed.   Charley begins to like Anne, and vice-versa, except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life (her husband was a cheater) and they decide to give it a shot - two weeks of faithfulness.   I will not give away anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on screen. She is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic, middle-aged comedy, but her touch with comedy is very light and agreeable. She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself.   Art Carney is a riot all by himself as a practically senile doctor. The scene where the baseball team owner's ashes are buried at home plate is priceless. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to Carney and Matthau; the role does not tax his considerable talents, but he had to have had a good time making this comedy.   Very much recommended...8/10  PS. FYI -- Matthau presented Jackson with her first Best Actress Oscar, and Jackson presented Best Actor to Art Carney for his role in 'Harry & Tonto'..\",\n",

While I\\'ll give \\'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately, it was only just that: halfway decent.  If you like movies where things aren\\'t all neatly wrapped up, and don\\'t mind low-budget effects, you might like this film. Honestly, it wasn\\'t really my cup of tea. I should\\'ve just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching.  For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even LOWER budget (!) have a look at \"Primer.\"',\n",
       " b'It\\'s worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie\\'s \"real life.\" \"Fire\" speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native, and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer\\'s awareness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the finest film i\\'ve seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!',\n",
       " b\"I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak. The storyline and the pacing are brilliant, and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world The acting was great, and the script is to me one of the best ones ever produced in Colombian soil. I think that anyone around the globe can get a good one hour and a half of entertainment, with a beautifully well directed bluffing black humor comedy. It kind of reminded me of films like snatch, and others of the sort. I highly recommend it and hope it can be viewed by more people, since Colombian movies seem to have started to be more internationally focused since last year.\",\n",

A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.\",\n",
       " b\"This may contain ***SPOILERS***  Where to start on this particular empty wasteland? Well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot. Acting talent, decent dialog, suspense, humor, hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick. Unfortunately there was only a lot of gore, (even that wasn't done well), shooting automatic weapons and missing.  There seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise, a Native American cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, with his being tracked down by a Federal Special Ops team who dressed in civvies(?). Most of the time involved violating one of the basic rules of conduct in a Horror movie, separating from the group so you can be picked off one by one. You'd think this team would know better, especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. When they finally realize they're being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot. Tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money.  When they're not shooting trees they're tracking this spirit who leaves no trail, (who knows how they're tracking it), and spouting a lot of macho BS. By the way, did I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting listening to them talk tough. Not very entertaining, but interesting.  All in all, You can find better movies in the bargain bin at Kmart.\",\n",
       " b'This is a really sad, and touching movie! It deals with the subject of child abuse. It\\'s really sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens everyday. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who just tries to make a home for them. While living with her parents, a man, who likes to be called \"The King\" comes into their life. He hits the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother. But finally she finds out, after the Bobby is hurt badly. The end kind of ruined it for me, because it is so totally unbelievable. But, except for that, I love the movie.',\n",
       " b'This movie is just as bad as it gets. If you like logic (or the lack of it) \\xc3\\xa1 la National Treasure and bad acting as well, then it could be a movie for you.  Otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer.  Actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved (ie. actors, special effects and so on). Accidentially they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent.  In a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product.  It is really lousy.',\n",
       " b\"It's unbelievable but the fourth is better than the second and the third. After the third that was awful, it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas. Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies. Interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done....\",\n",
       " b\"A few yrs ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that Rozzie R. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).  I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'.  Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading. And she won't let either of them have a piece of her until ...  I won't give away the ending - but I will say that this is ultimately Bland Whitebread Boy's fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. Except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison.\",\n",
       " b\"Contains Spoilers  Luchino Visconti's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (Britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonian/Dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer). It is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made.   In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. Never has Venice looked more beautiful and alluring, more decadent and effete. If you've read the novella, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, aroused passion and finally, pitiful yearning of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was perfectly cast. He too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. The Tadzio character is pivotal to the story, so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And changing Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto from the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant stroke. Although I'd read the Mann story before the film, Mahler's music and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. As will the haunting images which appear throughout the film, especially that last one of Ashenbach dying on the beach as Tadzio walks slowly into the sea.   One day this film will be released in DVD widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us.\",\n",
       " b'If you thought NBC\\'s 10.5 was stupid, you\\'ll be happy to hear that FX reached into the bowels of made-for-TV hell and squished it\\'s fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused \"docu-action\" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W \"rawcore\" footage. I\\'m not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming. I don\\'t know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks Powerpoint presentations with \"fly-ins\" and \"animations\" are \"cool.\"  The story is that 6 \"terrorists\" take over a nuclear power plant in southern CA. That\\'s right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there\\'s security precautions up the ying-yang. For the sake of reality, they put 2 off-duty CHiPpies in the mix. Because, they\\'d be able to stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid Nakatomi building.  Leslie Hope (TV\\'s Teri Bauer) plays a CHP officer who has problems talking on the phone after she\\'s shot in her bullet-proof vest. Her voice sounds like a Sally Struther\\'s TV ad, whiny and monotonous. Her character is only a plot device, and after she performs her one small duty, she is promptly disposed of. Yes, Teri Bauer is died!   Bruce Greenwood stars as FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. His boss is out, so nobody over at the Dept. of Homeland Security believes his prognosis of the situation. He\\'s the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe. He\\'s calm, he\\'s strong, he\\'s BORING.  There is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about Meltdown - OK, well maybe Teri Bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny - other than that, nothing redeeming.',\n",
       " b'Accepted...let\\'s see. The only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when Shrader(sp?) said, \"ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER\". After that i HAD to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends...and WOW amazing. One of the best films of the year. THe entire movie i was laughing like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) doesn\\'t get accepted into any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he DID make it into college. So he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents...until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS ONE CLICK AWAY) and all these rejects come to this school. They face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10/10 LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT',\n",
       " b'\"Broadcast News\" is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they\\'re all too unlikable to really care about them.  Some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason it doesn\\'t entirely work, is it\\'s a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.  You could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it\\'s often too silly to be successful there as well. Still, the script makes it worth a watch. Certainly not for everyone.  7.0 out of 10',\n",
       " b'What\\'s fun about Barker\\'s Nightbreed is that it\\'s the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the \"good\" guys. It shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first Addams Family movie, and much of Tim Burton\\'s work. It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.  Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the Nightbreed. As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters\\' castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic \"weapons\" with guns and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein\\'s monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.  This isn\\'t a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. But it\\'s pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. Worth a look!',\n",
       " b\"Some films just fade away, but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite. Though not completely original--it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it holds its own with a sense of humor, genuine creepy moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio, and the fun performances by Chuck Connors and the cast. Don't let the PG rating keep you away, this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining. Those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film. Here, the scares are merited and effective. Plus, only Chuck Connors could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on DVD in widescreen, this film is a must for fans of '70s horror fare.\",\n",
       " b'Wow, this film was terrible. It is as simple as that. It is actually the first time that I walked out early, as far as I can remember. This turned out okay, though: I had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a \"movie\".  Where to start. Bad acting, bad jokes. Faecal humour, which I simply cannot stand. Sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. You have seen the title picture? That scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two \"heroes\" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. It is not.  Apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, I do not remember much about this. At least not much good. I was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. Or let us be honest here: given that I am actually a big fan of \"british\" (i.e., black) humour, I was angry.  So, want my advice? Three words: do not watch.',\n",
       " b\"I can think of no movie that better captures the concept of grace, in a theological sense. The well-intentioned religiosity of a small congregation, gone awry after the death of their leader, robs from them the very thing they preach: grace. The costly gift of a humbled Parisian culinary genius returns them to their calling to love one another, and humbles an aging general concerned that he's wasted his life. CHOICES is a central theme, as well as grace. At the same time, artistic gifting is recognized as having a powerful, transcendent role to play in everyday life, and the life to come. Impossible to improve or ignore. This is a life-changing film for those who hear its message.\",\n",
       " b'Do yourself a favor and stay away from this film. Minus 50 billion out of 10. If you want hard boiled action don`t rent it! If you want a good independent film look elsewhere!  I never thought i`d see Burt Reynolds in such a crappy movie. It has the thinnest plot-line ever. Van Damm flicks should win an Academy compared to this one.  Rob Lowe once again prove why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a better drug addict than him. I do not want to bore you with more facts about this crappy movie, except to say that you are better off renting anything by Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point, if you get my drift.  ',\n",
       " b\"The book was one of Stephen King's best. The movie was pure rubbish. It was painful to remain in the theater until the ending, which wasn't even the same as the book. I guess that this is the result when you try to cram 10 pages of story into every minute. There is no good reason to watch this movie.\",\n",
       " b'beautifully constructed, \"Traffik\" tells the story of narcotics usage and commerce from multiple points of view. From a policeman view, from a politician view, from an addict view, from a smuggler\\'s view, and from a farmer\\'s view. In a carefully contructed storyline, one gets the impression on how everything is inter-related. From beautiful on-location shots in the poppy fields in Pakistan, to downtown Karachi, to the entry points airports of Frankfurt and London, to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption.',\n",
       " b\"I've been on a bad run of films. This is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really enjoy, was pretty young here. He is a builder with a passion, but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over-insuring and burning. Into the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter, and her nut-case boyfriend. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot, given a little warning, would know something was rotten in the nation of Australia. Still, they bumble their way. The most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built, never got beyond being a bunch of sticks. Low budget, I guess. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a film editor (the did?). Half the time you don't know where the characters are, but I guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory. It doesn't work. Although there is lots of neat fire.\",\n",
       " b'On the positive, I\\'ll say it\\'s pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I\\'m not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called \"buzz\", and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would\\'ve been amazing. And I expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future, they clearly have the ability. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.',\n",
       " b\"Okay, I admit I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I just have a thing for 6' tall women with swords. There I said it.  What's wrong with the movie? Just about every mistake you can make was made. You take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst thing of all...you put a cute kid in there for comic relief. This kind of thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series ya know. Cute kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. The plot had Schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling Red Sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. A warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! To not re-use the Conan character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike Conan the Barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. When it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.  This movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.\",\n",
       " b'I really enjoyed The Patriot. This movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. One line in the movie from wesley mclaren (seagal) stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society, \"western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and I am in the business of curing it.\"  ',\n",
       " b\"This hugely entertaining short is considered one of the best shorts ever, and I certainly won't argue with that. Even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are created with regularity, this film still manages to stand out. If you ever get the chance to view this film, please do so. It's only ten minutes long, and yet it contains a man who is obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuums the bathtub, and a nuclear war. What more could you want in a film?\",\n",
       " b\"I caught this movie right in my eye when I was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema. The tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought of the possibility of it being similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, aside from having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my exams for a tension releaser.  Delightfully, I came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes definitely kicked it off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life, coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to. This movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way of pulling it off is through this movie.  The principal is obviously sickly hilarious in a serious manner, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. I'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughs throughout the movie. It is a definite guarantee.\",\n",
       " b\"I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film. This movie totally grates on my nerves.\",\n",
       " b'This is a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted film. It is funny and sometimes hilarious. The finale is a bit disappointing, since it tries to wrap everything up into too neat a package. The film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: the Jane Austen staging, the camping trip as examples. B & H does not attempt to mirror the predominant attitudes toward homosexuality and bisexuality. Most of the characters are quite accepting of sexual diversity. In that sense it is a joyous vacation from homophobic society. And it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories--perhaps a happy harbinger of things to come.',\n",
       " b\"This Metro film is episodic, but nearly a constant series of chases, mainly trying to escape police, whether real or imagined, as Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. It is consistently inventive and entertaining. Its greatest value is in its documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties, since 95% of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time. One gem moment and one gem sequence are present here.  The great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with Buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within seconds.  The great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor - one of the great Keaton gags.  Kino's print is sharp and clear - almost pristine. There is a violin/piano score accompaniment. This is one to seek out and enjoy.\",\n",
       " b'I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but \"The Possession of Nurse Sherri\" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like \"Horror of the Blood Monsters\" and \"Dracula Vs. Frankenstein\". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you\\'re going to jump out of your seat when you watch \"Nurse Sherri\"? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from \"The Exorcist\", \"Ruby\", and \"Carrie\" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. You can\\'t put your finger on what\\'s so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (And what an ending! Don\\'t worry, I won\\'t spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with this one, and it doesn\\'t matter whether \"Nurse Sherri\" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. \"Nurse Sherri\" was a Poverty Row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubin\\'s theme music for the late \\'50s/early \\'60s television series \"One Step Beyond\" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot, and a great commentary by Sherman. Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy, by the way? Next to John Carradine, he\\'s the best actor I\\'ve ever seen in an Al Adamson film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it.',\n",
       " b\"I must admit this is one of Cameron Diaz's unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead. I was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters.  Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters(in real life). This is one of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing.She looked the part of the gorgeous ,rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause.  Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister Faith, little girl Phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for Europe. As she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister's boyfriend.  Great story and equally great location shooting around European.I will watch it again.\",\n",
       " b'This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn\\'t realise it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK), but this was awful. The family were so cheesy, \"Love you mum\" \"Love you even more honey\" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, \"Love you mum\" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home. They were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead, have a nutter living next door, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to look after her.  However, as a comedy, I\\'d give it a good 7. I might even show it to my friends next time I have them round. Could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!',\n",
       " b\"My God, Ryan Gosling has made a lot of deep characters in his career, this is one of his wonderful acting jobs. For me this is a very deep movie, needs a lot of concentration, not because is difficult to watch, just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid, even though has everything and has famous father that is a writer, has a deeper mind, you don't understand why he kills this poor kid, until you really heard what he has to say and you start to think, at least to me, that a lot of things that he says is true. Simple kid, sweet, very gentle, in a way normal like any teenage, but inside of him suffer because he start to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie for those who likes deep drama.\",\n",
       " b\"The art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current Danish cinema! Well, at least it is in this movie. Nobody in this movie are amused. They are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they aren't yet, they soon will be! It is a story of screw-ups, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and, in the end, love and redemption. The chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone, but personally I found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. You pity the characters from a distance, even as you dislike them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them, even when they get away with murder.  This is, in my judgment, definitely the best Danish movie of the last few years.  9 out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes--just 21 short of making it eligible to be on IMDb\\'s infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films on the website. With a paltry score of only 1.8, this would place the film at approximately between #38 and 46 on the list--talk about a very dubious achievement!! My score of 3 isn\\'t that bad--but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list.  As for the film, it stars the once-cute Aaron Carter--yet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first broke onto the scene, he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre-teens and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick--leading to some huge album sales. Unfortunately, by 2005, sales were in decline and Carter had hit his awkward stage of life--something ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually. To put it bluntly, he isn\\'t cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life. I assume now he\\'s a gorgeous young man...but in \"Popstar\" he\\'s no longer the heart-throb he once was. Here, he is just very normal...a death sentence for a kid in his position as a \"pop sensation\".  Interestingly, the film has some appearances by some other ex-teen heart-throbs from the last few decades--including a roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett--two guys who also know what it\\'s like to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will take after Cassidy in the future and so far, thankfully, he\\'s managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex-pop idols. I was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department. It\\'s not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s.  In this film, Carter doesn\\'t exactly need to stretch himself--he plays a pop star. However, despite making millions and being adored by girls, he doesn\\'t \"have it all\". He\\'s quite dense--mostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him--forcing him to go to public school. The problem, though, is that he is rather phobic about taking tests...and making the grade in school is difficult. So, he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date--one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school. He picks the cute but bookish Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work.  This plot, by the way, isn\\'t bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like \"The Brady Bunch\" or a Nickelodeon sit-com. Sure, it\\'s predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt AND he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her AND by the end of the film, all will be forgiven and they\\'ll be a real couple. But, given good acting and competent direction, this could be worth seeing for his teen fans, as predictable isn\\'t always bad. And, as it turned out, this ISN\\'T exactly where the plot went...but it was awfully close.  There are a few good things I liked about the film. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane\\'s grandparents was very nice--their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again. Also, 1970s made for TV movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film--it was nice to see him again--though part of me hated him, as he looks so great after all these years and I look ever bit of my 45 years! He did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother (Stella).  As for Carter, with his many prior experiences on TV, he was, not surprisingly, pretty good. While his relationship with Jane didn\\'t seem very believable, he and Ms. Austin gave it their best. The film wasn\\'t great, but they did try and I think most of the problems with the film were in the writing--with a better and less formulaic plot, it could have worked much better. Plus the whole \"testophobia\" angle seemed pretty contrived...and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school?! Overall, not a rotten film as the current rating would imply, though there isn\\'t much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter probably will enjoy the film. Older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven\\'t heard of him. For them, there is no nostalgia value in the film.  My favorite part of the film...Leif Garrett giving Aaron advice. I felt like screaming \"don\\'t listen!!\" but didn\\'t!',\n",
       " b\"This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic. The sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.\",\n",
       " b\"This film had some funny moments. Louie, the main character was well cast along with some other decent supporting characters. The opening shot of the movie set the tone but the direction and story went downhill from there. Aside from a twist at the end (interesting and funny also), I wish this film had better direction and a more developed story. Without giving any of the plot away, the whole idea is better good! I just wish it was executed better in this short film. The potential was there but it just didn't deliver the goods.\",\n",
       " b\"On one level, Hari Om is a film using a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: curious Westerner explores the mysterious East. But at its heart, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from vastly different cultures, their slowly growing attraction for each other, and the beautiful mad chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without damaging the story's plausibility. India and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and persuasively by locals recruited during the film's production while on the road between the Indian towns and villages that form the film's setting. One major negative for this viewer: a Keystone Kops chase near the film's conclusion as Hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. But the closing scenes where Isa and Hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.\",\n",
       " b'This review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was...  Saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants, like my Italian grandparents who came through Ellis Island at the turn of the last century, would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter America.  It was certainly eye opening, since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there. My grandmother was 5-years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived.  I just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process - The filmmaker obviously did his research, right down to the medical exams and equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there at the museum. Even the wedding pictures and the review board room -- Factually correct! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. Inspirational to say the least.',\n",
       " b'Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the clich\\xc3\\xa9 of the \"mentor\" and the \"talented immature pupil\". The characters aren\\'t\\' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I can\\'t have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...',\n",
       " b'lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more. he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an Oscar academy award. there are some actors that do not act very well but have a Oscar anyway. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful',\n",
       " b\"Sigh... what can I say?   Why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place. Its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly!  To have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad. To have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too! Such fanciful editing only appears in trailers. It cheapens the whole look!  And who are the Russian guys at the top of the movie? Who is the guy being tortured? Is he with the CIA?   This film deserved not to be released in theatre. But it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place. Its a joke to Hollywood.\",\n",
       " b'Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I\\'m a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely under-used and has SO much more to offer besides \"Agent Mulder\" (although I\\'m a huge fan of that series too), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven\\'t seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows love never dies... it\\'s with you forever. Minnie Driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing Mr. O\\'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This movie didn\\'t get any type of awards nod, but deserved one. Great job Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way... the soundtrack is great too! **',\n",
       " b'Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking \"surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on\", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far.   The basic story is perhaps not even that bad, but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever. The tree as a \\'scary\\' device might be okay if used cleverly, but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of...yes, a tree, over and over again. He seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it just feels like what it is: shots of a tree. For goodness\\' sake!  Slow build-ups can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares, but not Acacia. Sure, we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and, yet again, meaningful shots of the tree from above, or underneath, or the side, but these scenes are just not scary. They feel silly, especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary. They simply aren\\'t.   Apart from that I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. In particular the one character\\'s \\'descent into madness\\' is laughable. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible editing. Its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are, but it\\'s bad, and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had. It also makes me feel patronised, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it, but I cannot believe that they think I would fall for such cheap ploys.  There are lots of great Asian ghost films, and lots of bad ones, but this is by far the worst I have seen. They must have been going through the list of \\'what to put into ghost movies\\', and ticked them all off, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.',\n",
       " b'I am not quite sure what to say/think about this movie. It is definitely not the worst in the series (there\\'s still \"Halloween 3\"). The style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor did. It tries to explain why Michael Myers freaks out on Halloween and starts butchering around. Well, all that stuff about Michael Myers being cursed and the evil cult was a rather nice effort, but I didn\\'t buy it. None of the other installments in the series tried to come up with any fancy explanations.  The movie contains lots of gore. Actually it\\'s plain carnage. If you haven\\'t seen the other Halloween films you will probably like this one for its blood content. But for a real Halloween freak this sequel might be just too different to be seen as a good one. Suspense was turned into terror and carnage (exploding heads..., you get the point).  The ending (theatrical cut) is simply awful. Michael gets stabbed with a needle, then beaten up with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beaten up a little more until there\\'s slime running out of his head (where did this green stuff come from anyway?). Basically it\\'s nothing more than trash worth 5 million $.  There was one good thing though: Michael\\'s mask!  Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite a disgrace.   My rating: 4/10',\n",
       " b\"Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood in scene after scene of lush colors, evocative yet restrained sensuality (as opposed of the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which has become part of the norm of a romance in film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It's not hard to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, since she is known for minimalism in storytelling as well as describing powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond as well as the use of re-enacting scenes that could eventually take place in both the characters' lives. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes which explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship.  The plot even resembles something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. The question is, should they act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? Every scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see it. And just as not seeing either of their spouses heightens their own love story, not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation even the more bitter because at every moment we want for something to happen -- some catalyst -- and the only one which comes is when Leung reveals to her that he loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he. It also gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, a consummation of their romance into a more solid, lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but as it's Hong Kong, cultural values are markedly different.  Performances here are of the high order: it's very easy to play a torrid love affair, but to continually play a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire only barely suggested is hard and makes all the sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung smolder and their blighted chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.\",\n",
       " b\"That someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible. That it actually aired on television and advertisers actually PAID TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT is mind boggling. This stomach-wrenching excuse for kid's programming is almost too vile to comment on. I've burned -- yes burned -- any Barney tapes that people have given my son. To find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, do they get those smarmy kid actors? Have their parents no sense? Those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers. Geez. The final insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.\",\n",
       " b'Well,this movie is really \"PLUMPED\" HAHA Get it? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if \"PLUMP\" (haha)! is really unbelievable.The storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. It did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. I mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh. Most of the supposedly \"Funny\" moments are completely ironic. The film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall. They could have done a much funnier job,seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film,they were gambling,and hey! I think they lost!  In overall PLUMP Fiction,is \"PLUMPABLE\" but you wont gather much at all!  Worth watching over and over again?: No once is enough,actually its more than enough!  So is it worth the rent? Ummm..As I said,Its \"PLUMPABLE\",but you will only gather a few \"PLUMPS\" from it!  Overall out of 10: a 4 out of 10!',\n",
       " b'A lot of people say the end did not make sense, but it did. With the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off, having picked up a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend.   vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi.   The only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. So that is a problem.   The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship. I assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown.   What about all the humans killed? Do their qui forces (\"souls\") go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? In other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures.   The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars \"Force\" or even re-incarnation.   This movie was over the top, kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and end were ethereal. It both began (\"what is happening to me\") and ended as a love story.   Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as being ludicrous, it all fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people. Maybe they didn\\'t need Patrick Steward\\'s blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene.   Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie\\'s core. Its a lover story,from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why I love it.   Instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. It was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls twinkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life.   Most people can\\'t deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.',\n",
       " b\"I am a huge Shirley Temple fan. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley actually was. Ashley Rose Orr made possibly the worst on-screen Shirley. Imagine an 11 year old playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5. That in itself is wrong. But getting her to 'mimick' Shirley's voice? And her singing is woeful. The dancing was good, I'll say that. As previous users have said, there was little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart... I would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz, when in reality, Shirley was just considered for Dorothy. The film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role. Shirley herself said that she is glad Judy Garland got to play her. For me the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For great Shirley Temple films, watch Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.\",\n",
       " b'If at all possible, try to view all five of the Universal \"Mummy\" films in order, not so much for the continuity between films, but for the very evident lack thereof. Of course it goes without saying that the original Boris Karloff classic \"The Mummy\" really shouldn\\'t even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called \"sequels\", all of which come off as campy or cultish.   This time around, it\\'s revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka have made their way to the United States. And once again, as your eyes deceive you, Kharis the Mummy didn\\'t really die for the second time in \"The Mummy\\'s Tomb\", but is alive and searching for his lost love Princess Ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves brewed during the cycle of the full moon. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a caretaker, ably filled by a gaunt John Carradine as Yousef Bey, entrusted with the task by George Zucco\\'s Andoheb, high priest of Arkan.   Kharis and Ananka are to be returned to their final resting place in the hills of Arkan in Egypt. But as we\\'ve seen before, being entrusted with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure, with Carradine\\'s character falling for the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It\\'s shocking to see Yousef Bey and the PO\\'ed bandaged one come to blows over the gorgeous Amina.   Riddle me this - in both \"Tomb\" and \"Curse\", Lon Chaney portrays the Mummy with a limp right arm folded helplessly across his chest. When he encounters the fainted Amina, he lifts her up in both arms with no problem; as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to it\\'s crippled position once again.  The ending of the film is most notable - the monster gets the girl! But it\\'s a short lived victory, as the Mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy grave, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled - \"The fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death\".',\n",

       " b\"Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all times. they only aired the first 2 seasons in India but i've watched the rest on DVD or read it online. it's very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist isn't sneaking around her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who play Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, though extremely quirky, are still believable. the residents of stars hollow show all the amusing bizarreness of small town life, which is contrasted by the endless snobbishness and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. on one hand there are dance-athons and firelight festival's while on the hand you have cotillions, DAR meetings and cocktail parties. all the character's develop a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less everybody. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend Lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.\",\n",
       " b\"This show is pathetic. I can't even begin to imagine how anyone with an IQ greater than that of a can of split pea soup that's past its expiration date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour. It is one of those rare shows that is so mind-numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it. I conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. That is second only to another Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and pretty much a tie with Girls Will Be Girls. Keys to the VIP owes each and every one of us an apology. Whenever I watch this travesty of a show, I feel sad for society. How is it allowed to continue?\",\n",
       " b\"Years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. Deathly boring, I found it hard to sit through as I could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery'. Is Sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. No one at all. Skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks.  My Grade: D-\",\n",
       " b\"There is more to this movie than meets the eye. If you're looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy, you'll be disappointed. But for an entertaining 90 minutes, this is just fine.  The cinematography is careful and precise. The sex scenes, which one comment decries as gratuitous, are anything but - every gesture contributes to the development of the characters.  Yes, some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings. But the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light, without being sensationalistic (at least not for early 21st century urban standards). And there are many very amusing moments.\",\n",
       " b\"All through his career Hitchcock did great films; this was not one of them.  A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama.  Anyone who has seen 1930s Fritz Lang films- 'M' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time. There is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace, darkness, and depravity that Hitchcock might have been seeking to instil.  What it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the Albert Hall. Once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion. The camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it.\",\n",
       " b\"I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I've watched her on many TV shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new T3 movie I wanted to check out what other movies she has been in.  She's just OK in terms of acting. Not good and not bad either. She makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous. YUMMMMM  Rodney Rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. He provided the only solid good acting in the movie. He's a very good actor and should probably be an action star.  Besides Kristanna being OK and Rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form.  A computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. And of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game.  This is one of the worst scripts I have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick.  What's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the September 11th tragedies.  Why do they make movies like this in the first place?  Panic * - one star (a waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)\",\n",
       " b\"Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction.  It had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything.  This film looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music.  Others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - I had to take a break purely because I just didn't care anymore.  Reminded me of an episode of Days of our Lives with marginally more suspense.  Just bad.\",\n",
       " b'I initially tuned in to Paranormal State because I (more or less) find the paranormal search genre to be interesting TV, if nothing else.  I really enjoy Ghost Hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking, and find Most Haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy British women with Paris Hilton day-glo eyes fainting from fear/demonic presences all shot in lovely night-vision green.  Paranormal State has none of this appeal. It feels like it was cobbled together from \"leads\" that Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves, to an \"interview\" with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room (the monster goes RAWRRR, we are told). All of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. He leads his troupe of doe-eyed coeds around, except when a case is deemed \"too extreme\" and orders them to remain at the hotel HAHAHA. Better leave it to the pros, ie himself.  The unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are. Ryan spins his tales of being hunted, followed, etc by a demon that he first encountered when the Catholic Church recruited him to assist on a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do that, they don\\'t need the day-shift manager at Quiznos to chip in his 2 cents.  This show is awful, shame on A&E for bankrolling this silliness, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal-themed shows. It\\'s almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn\\'t worth the trouble.',\n",
       " b'This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is, then this would be it. I think I\\'m not really a fan of horror movies, not that I\\'m chicken, but rather this year alone, I haven\\'t been genuinely spooked by what\\'s on offer so far, be it from the West, or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great premise, but poor execution, relying on clich\\xc3\\xa9d techniques (I think these are the only tools of the trade available?) to try and elicit some heart thumping moments.  Se-jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman, who one day notices that some apartments in the block of flats opposite hers, undergo blackouts simultaneously at precisely 9:56pm everyday. No, she\\'s no voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighbourhood, including one which she encounters herself on a subway, start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths.  With horror movies, there\\'s always a pseudo-logical explanation within the movie about how the spooks come about. That\\'s just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film, the unravelling of the \"Truth\", although it won\\'t take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through. Which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie.  There\\'s a myriad of characters like the wheelchair bound girl, and the neighbours who take turns to care for her, as well as a schoolgirl, detective, a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train commuter. But following genre formula, these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths, or in this case, pointless red herring characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to mislead the audience, nevermind if they convolute, or add little to forward the plot.  And don\\'t get me started on the techniques employed here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long hair ghouls (ahhhhhhh, so passe!) who can\\'t move properly, copious amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free, and the list goes on. But credit to the sound engineers for creating some ear piercing bone crunching sounds used each time the spooks move, though it seems like a one trick pony.  Don\\'t waste time on this, even if you\\'re a horror fan. It\\'s a complete waste of a promising premise, and in the end, you feel like you\\'ve just be taken on a ride. A very long and painful one to endure. It\\'s high time for some innovation in this genre, otherwise one film will easily look like another, with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and can someone oil those doors while they\\'re at it as well.',\n",
       " b'I am a massive Hitchcock fan, ever since seeing \"Rear Window\" on television. \"Saboteur\" is not Hitchcock\\'s best for me though, it is very good but not a masterpiece. It does have its faults, some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete. But Hitchcock\\'s direction is superb, and the performances weren\\'t that bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do a good enough job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd come very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a wronged man on the run, very similar themes used in \"39 Steps\" and \"North By Northwest\", and cleverly provides some much needed escapism. The music score was absolutely outstanding; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the digs at Tchaikovsky\\'s 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven\\'s 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. Namely the Statue of Liberty climax, but the circus troupe encounter and the Radio Music City Hall shoot-out is also on the money. Overall, not Hitchcock\\'s best, but definitely worth the look. 8/10 Bethany Cox',\n",
       " b'This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach\\'s house) that are really used. It\\'s primarily at the coach\\'s house, however. A movie doesn\\'t need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.  Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. One is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic.  First off, I love the actors in this film. They\\'ve all been household names to me. They proved their worth here.  One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up on the coach. He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. His blows the coach\\'s whistle and yells back his catchphrases - \"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!\" It\\'s amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.  Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn\\'t need shiny effects to interest them.',\n",
       " b'This is a wonderful movie...it\\'s funny, dark, poignant, thought-provoking, innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around. I don\\'t know that I\\'ve seen the like before...\"The Rapture,\"or maybe one of Todd Solondz\\'s black-as-night \"comedies\" or even the recent movie \"Teeth\" come to mind...but those are all bitter, nasty little gems. \"Franklins,\" despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart.  The story is similar to John Waters\\' \"Low Down Dirty Shame,\" only this film differs in that it actually HAS a story, and something to say as well, beyond Waters\\' juvenile \"Sex isn\\'t dirty (snicker, nudge-nudge)\" message. A conservative, repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren\\'t so conservative anymore...in fact, they\\'re finally actually happy, probably the only people in their town (or maybe the entire world) who are. To talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film; simply put, everyone should see it, though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie\\'s upbeat, hopeful philosophy is ever would.  The acting is great--just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy...Teresa Willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when she\\'s freed up. Both she and Robertson Dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes); they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a \"deviant sex practice\" into a touching, believable and endearing moment. Aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, angst and speech patterns of a girl her age. Vince Pavia as the \"himbo\" brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting. Mari Blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother Franklin is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over-the-top.  Technically the film looks fantastic, all bright colors and wide-open locales...it looks like it may have been shot Hi-def...if so, the line has gotten very thin, it looks very much like film. There is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical, which gets a bit preachy (moreso, I\\'d imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the film\\'s politics), but this film says a lot of things that need saying...if only people wouldn\\'t be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that take place are smart and well thought out, first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious OR non-religious parties.  The ending is on the ambiguous side, which I found a bit of a disappointment somehow...I think it would\\'ve worked better had the author (as Jay Floyd is, since he produced, wrote and directed) given a more workable denouement, some sort of solution, but then again, there probably isn\\'t one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another. All the same, it was a moving, memorable final image that left me choked up--a success. Meanwhile, I\\'m awfully glad Mr. Floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Check it out.',\n",
       " b\"There have been many movies, on living the American dream. And this is one of them.  First of all, on the technical side, there is a lot wrong. The audio is bad, i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better.  They really tried to come up with a good movie, but for example the part where they show, how Jonathan is loosing himself in the dream,with girls, drugs and alcohol, is done very badly. The acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie.  I had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.  If your expectations are low, and you're bored on a Sunday with bad weather, watch it. If you in for a deep story with action, then this is not your movie.  Normally i would not have give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. But the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects.\",\n",
       " b'Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I\\'m wondering why Cagney wasn\\'t in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it\\'s another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole \"swimming\" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.  One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast. As the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.',\n",

       " b\"Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese auteur Mikio Naruse, now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas, now middle-aged, whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. Performance are uniformly outstanding, particularly that of Haruko Sugimura, who starred in films by Ozu's Late Spring, Floating Weeds, and Tokyo Story among others. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.  She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money, particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishas. Kin's friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children. Tamae's son is leaving to work in the coalmines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.  Two male friends visit Kin, Seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, though their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves merely as victims. Late Chrysanthemums has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.\",\n",

The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew. I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall the movie is great! And hats off to Mr.Maniratnam.  Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again. An excellent film and a must see.\",\n",
       " b\"Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done. However Karen Carpenter turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you weren't a Carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.\",\n",
       " b'I went to see this film out of curiosity, and to settle an argument. The film is now best known from the suite of music Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film, the Troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements. The general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings. A clerk accidentally generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. The tsar is interested in this person, and rather than tell him he doesn\\'t exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, is given a state funeral, revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks.  I had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, involving ink blots and sneezes, but I\\'d heard the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. Then the film turned up at the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. As the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there\\'s no time to correct the mistake.  Having gone expecting an historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the audience, myself included, laughed continuously. Although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few \"trick\" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. For instance, the tsar\\'s army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. Four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison. Two identical servants scrub the floor.  One slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. There were two women who might have been the tsar\\'s daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people were named. But all in all, an enjoyable film and I\\'m surprised it\\'s not seen more often.',\n",

       " b\"Okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct MM2 and MM3, I thought, heck, I got to check out Monster Man and see what its like, maybe I can get a part in it, but when I popped it into my DVD player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad I mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the pointless desert road trip, I cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot. The story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster/Hollywood Video shelf put out by Lions gate these days, but they surely messed this one up. Why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie. Myabe the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes???? All in all, and I'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street, I will give it at least 1 star for trying, and the gore/kill scenes weren't that bad, again, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. I don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. CRAP!\",\n",

       " b'(Some Spoilers) Early 1930\\'s educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one\\'s unborn children, and finally death. \"Damaged Lives\" is far ahead of it\\'s times in educating it\\'s viewers about the dangers Venereal Deasise. viewed now over 70 years after it\\'s release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940\\'s 1950\\'s and even 1960\\'s.  Donald Bradley, Lyman Williams, is a top executive of a major shipping company who\\'s been going study with his girlfriend Joan, Diane Sinclair, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. Out at a party one evening Donald meets Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in Elsie\\'s home.   Thinking nothing of his one night stand with Elsie Donald later marries his long time love Joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. At the office Donald get a panicked call from Elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. Rushing over Donald finds out, to his horror, that Elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she may have given it to Donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife Joan. Telling Elsie that she\\'s wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention Elsie shoots herself as Donald is just about to leave.   Getting over Elsie\\'s tragic death Donald gets another surprise later when his doctor Dr. Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Vincent Leonard, Murray Kinnell, about his wife Joan who\\'s just been admitted there. The terrible truth about Donald and his wife Joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did Joan earlier. Both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930\\'s, infection called Venereal Disease.   Told by Dr. Leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both Donald and Joan to be completely cured it leaves Joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the film Joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and Donald\\'s apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and Donald who was asleep at the time.   Honest film about the ravages of Venereal Disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one\\'s doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it\\'s too late.',\n",
       " b\"OK where do I start? I saw a screening a couple weeks ago and I was shocked how bad this movie is. Sure if you just LOVE Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best TV shows on air then you will definitely love this movie. Me, personally, I really like George's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. Some people are natural in comedy and I am sure he is great & funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen. It was a cute movie but would I pay $12.00 to see it? H&LL no !!!! Now that I have seen it I would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. George, buddy, I love you but please don't do any more comedies?

       " b'While amiable and amusing for gay audiences, Frank Oz\\'s film \"In and Out,\" about a closeted gay teacher who has been outed on national television by a former student, has been sanitized and deodorized to appeal to the larger and more profitable straight viewers that patronized \"The Bird Cage.\" Although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around Kevin Kline\\'s Howard Brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. The movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in Barbra Streisand movies, and dress well indicates one\\'s sexual orientation. Like \"Queer Eye,\" the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so \"In and Out\" is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.  Unfortunately, at the center of the film\\'s humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. A three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching \"Funny Lady.\" Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard\\'s intended, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. Most of the film\\'s funniest moments belong to her, although Kline\\'s attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the movie\\'s gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in \"Godfather II.\"   Although well intentioned, \"In and Out\" fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. Most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about Howard\\'s self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard\\'s parents, endearingly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students rise to support him. However, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to Howard Brackett in the film. The movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, \"In and Out\" perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they be positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history.',\n",
       " b'I have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things.  1. What I\\'ll call the \"stupid victim syndrome\". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - shoot him please. If you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer\\'s back - shoot him please.  2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don\\'t put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract - making you squeeze your finger.  3. It\\'s really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not noticing that you aren\\'t dead. Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier.  4. Technically, the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone, that is murder.  5. What was Adam\\'s lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam\\'s crime? Maybe I just missed something.  Other than those things, I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good, and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor\\'s part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed contrived and just didn\\'t work for me. Thank goodness I didn\\'t have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund.',\n",
       " b\"Now, I've seen many many B-grade films in my 15 years of living, and I must say that this was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline, but it did suffer from amateur acting (although Adrienne Barbeau did give a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms couldn't hold his part well enough to be considered good. The other performance which really fit the film was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It begins with an eager real estate agent taking an Asian couple through a house, only to find there's a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. It progresses with detective speculating, and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace. I think that for any person who's in for a giggle at the over-the-top drama the victim realtors provide during the over-the-top gory scenes, this truly is a gem... XD Who am I kidding? It's not that great, but worth a watch if you're insanely bored.\",\n",

Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has *expressive* eyes. For that matter, all the actors were attractive! Why it didn't do well in its theatrical release, I don't know--other than the studio didn't seem to have much of a push behind it. But it deserved to do better, and I hope it does well on video.

Apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young.  Why was this crematorium really shut down? What actually happened there in the past?  I like these kill-kill-kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films. The highlights of this film are a petty theft \"7-11\" robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view, the changing clothes scene by the \"good girl\" witnessed by her jerk younger brother, the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; that scene rocks.',\n",

Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.  The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and trite sports theme. But alas, the screenplay was too weak for ANY cast to pull it off. And this cast is no exception.  There is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not all bad from that aspect.

This film is not available on DVD although it is a classic and very rarely shown on TV. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey upset him so much. We will never know. The film should be colorized by someone and excerpts should be made into a Kinks video.

       " b\"`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. However, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star. I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. It reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. I guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** Average\",\n",

This film is true in setting, atmosphere and dialogue to Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood'), and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of English upper class country life is very accurate).  I loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an UK-compatible DVD\",\n",
       " b\"This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which Steve Carrell could do his improv. And that is what he does best, but it just didn't work here. The script was hard to follow, the story was non-sensical, and scenes were random and lacked direction. Also, much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by THAT MUCH! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users.  This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never once laughed while I was watching this movie. Yes, I had a couple of light moments, a couple of chuckles, but no real laughs. Nothing that struck me at all.  Spoiler Alert! One ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army knife...but instead of just using THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE, he tries to SHOOT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow miss-fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again (almost putting out his EYE), Max doesn't give up or try the blade instead...no, he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What was he really expecting to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be THE WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bindings. It just made absolutely no sense.  That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated, and made of pure nonsense. And that was truly distracting.  As I said, this movie was a big let-down, and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving. It degrades the authenticity of the site.\",\n",
       " b\"I stopped watching this film half way through. It was just terrible! Boring, contrived subplots. A complete lack of the pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback's portrayal of Ed Gein. A movie doesn't have to be historically accurate, but the true story of Ed Gein is so much more interesting than this third-rate melodrama that was completely made up for no good reason! Ed Gein as portrayed by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. The attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it even screwed that up. Fortunately, there is a better film of this story. 2001's Ed Gein told the story efficiently, and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein that time, was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is the one to see. Avoid this mess.\",\n",
       " b'\"... the beat is too strong ... we\\'re deaf mutants now--like them\", Rex Voorhas Ormine  I am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed. Let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of \"The Beat\" and why YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW.  Make no mistake, this movie is cheesy and \"bad\" in the conventional sense: the story is preposterous, the poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent.  But these are the film\\'s CHARMS--all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most UNDERAPPRECIATED CHEEZY FILMS of the 80\\'s.  If the reference to \"deaf mutants\" didn\\'t pique your interest, then perhaps this will: What kind of name is \"Rex Voorhas Ormine\", anyway? It is such an unusual name (for North American audiences) that I said to myself, \"even the names of the characters in this friggin\\' movie are firggin\\' silly.\"  Well, \"The Beat\" is so fabulously cheezy that the \"meaning\" and \"symbolism\" behind \"Rex Voorhas Ormine\" is revealed not-too-subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate). I won\\'t spoil the revelation behind Rex\\'s name, but please don\\'t get too excited, O.K.?  Overall, the acting is inconsistent (John Savage--who plays the \"concerned teacher\" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, as is the fellow playing Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast are unconvincing). That said, the acting does NOT detract from the film. Why? There is a SINCERITY in each of the actors\\' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. So although the performances may suck, you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. As a result, the actors\\' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails (which is quite often).  The homage to \"beat poetry\" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Would you actually enjoy \"better quality\" or \"more respectable\" poetry--especially in a film like this?  Folks, that would be BORING (think about the droll they made us read in high school--sanitized to avoid \"corrupting the youth\", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you don\\'t like poetry or \"arty\" movies (with all of the \"intellectual\" posturing that implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART FILM!!!! How could you not enjoy the following?  \"do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? a woman\\'s scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad, oh the woman\\'s so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today, yeah--today!\"  Yes, that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout \"The Beat.\" But what about the story, you ask?  Well, the story is preposterous. But then again, that is the beauty of this film. Apart from some cliches, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot/story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the heck is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate angels? Do Billy and Kate REALLY understand what Rex is saying? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his poetry posse? (I\\'ve seen the movie several times and I still haven\\'t figured everything out.)  Will bad poetry and high school talent shows really END GANG VIOLENCE?  I guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like \"The Beat\"--a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere acting, and a \"mythopoetics conquers gang violence\" storyline that has YET TO BE RIVALLED BY ANY FILM EVER MADE.  Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore: The Cro-Mags make a rare film appearance as the \"Iron Skulls\" and it\\'s a hoot to see them perform several songs. I wish they included more concert footage, but maybe that will be an \"extra\" included on the \"collector\\'s edition\" DVD I fantasize about.  ',\n",
       " b'If you are like me and observed the original \"Benji\" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is, and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974.  My judgment is not entirely objective as I tend to have a favorable bias toward children\\'s films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. On the other hand I have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of \"Petticoat Junction\". Never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.  Benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney, Texas. If this sounds boring you would be advised to give \"Benji\" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a \"Benji\" fan (if there are still any out there).   Unlike \"My Dog Skip\", \"Monkey Business\" or \"Because of Winn-Dixie\" the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. \"Big Valley\\'s\" Peter Breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame.   If one of your children (of any age) appears to be finding \"Benji\" entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication.  Then again, what do I know? I\\'m only a child.',\n",
       " b\"If it weren't for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger, it would be easy to mistake this low-budget snoozer for a Sci-Fi channel pilot. The plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero, himself gifted, in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. Alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. Top-billed Louis Gossett, Jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered. Other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little.\",\n",
       " b'This was a pretty good episode. Though no \"Trapped in the Closet\" or \"Cartoon Wars,\" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell \"super cereal\" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I\\'m sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he\\'ll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake!), and he comes within inches of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act like everything is completely fine. Cartman crapping out the treasure at the end, though predictable, was pretty funny.',\n",
       " b'Where do I begin? I sat down ready to laugh a bit and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it\\'s indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, funnier and more entertaining than the first. This was just what I needed tonight.  There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say \"Oh My! No Way!\" or \"Ouch!\". Perfectly mastered and set up, each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I\\'m just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! Amazingly good.  9/10. Incredibly funny, Do Not Miss Out!',\n",
       " b'Well, the movie was no terrible, but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger. This movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born. I suggest reading the book \"one of a Kind\" the real unger story. They left out huge parts of his life. They also at times did not understand the real caractor that he was. The actual facts of his life were at times out of order. And in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have. So please don\\'t watch the movie; read the book. By the way I\\'m not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100% to the real story, but they did not even come close!!!',\n",
       " b\"If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one. We don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time. It's called entertainment folks!!!\",\n",
       " b'Why isn\\'t this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. Absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.  Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can\\'t help cringe when I recall some of his lines, like \"In or out? You\\'re worse than a cat!\" and \"Your lady friend isn\\'t a very good poker player. She\\'s just revealed her hand.\"  The raptors are a joke. Even I could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. It is an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. Not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me. I don\\'t seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier. Besides, the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away.  I am a big fan of Jurassic Park movies and of dinosaurs. Maybe the filmmakers didn\\'t anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on HBO late at night, like I did. If I could say one thing to anybody involved in this film, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park...  \"Just try to show a little respect.\"',\n",
       " b'This is ten times better than \"Who Wants To BE A Super Model\" on Bravo I think it is more true to the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. I enjoy seeing Tyra\\'s personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. I don\\'t always agree with the judges decision\\'s or Tyra\\'s comments and at least one of the winners, I feel did not deserve to win. But this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance.',\n",
       " b'Had it not been for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. Had it not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the acting here would be much more lauded. Had it not been for William Faulkner, perhaps To Kill a Mockingbird might never have been written in his shadow.  I found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird, may not have been as original as I\\'d always thought it was. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie. Oh, the \"whodunnit\" is different, but the underlying story, a lone righteous \"white\" attorney against a white Southern town defending a Black man is all too familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred, the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayal.  There\\'s not the depth of Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you\\'re just left with the sadness that, whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not, Harper Lee\\'s Mockingbird reflects. Nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read Faulkner\\'s book and saw his movie while in college in Alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years. Nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now, these many years later.  It\\'s all too sadly familiar, and one wishes there were an Addicus of our day to make it all right. Where Mockingbird leaves you with hope of that, rocking in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this movie leaves you just sad that pride from Black people might equal or better the pride of White people. But pride from either is no answer at all.  Rather, it\\'s the answer of Addicus we need, comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy, not pride, when facing each other in our differences.',\n",
       " b'Victor Sj\\xc3\\xb6str\\xc3\\xb6m\\'s \"K\\xc3\\xb6rkarlen\" plunges the viewer into life\\'s lower depths for much of its running time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of Death itself. Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a wretched sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year\\'s Eve. For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver\\'s own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver.  The scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as \"The Phantom Carriage\" or \"The Phantom Chariot\" in English-speaking countries) are eerie and mesmerizing, utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. Most strikingly, the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes are, however, the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy. Abruptly, without segue or explanation, we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a story-telling deficiency, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, sordid details on our own. It\\'s suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges, the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause, a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform.  While David Holm is our central figure the story\\'s true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying-- indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm\\'s behalf --she demands to see him, and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery.  At times this film resembles Dickens\\' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer over his misbehavior, and reform. I was also reminded of Sj\\xc3\\xb6str\\xc3\\xb6m\\'s 1917 drama \"Terje Vigen,\" in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone (a sequence echoed here). The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his \"Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru\" (a.k.a. \"The Outlaw and His Wife,\" 1918) that no man can outrun his fate. This time, however, it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate, for he\\'s given an unexpected second chance to make amends.  Viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title, but may not be prepared for this film\\'s painful examination of a troubled man\\'s alcoholic downfall. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate \"K\\xc3\\xb6rkarlen\" in its entirety. It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sj\\xc3\\xb6str\\xc3\\xb6m\\'s most accomplished works.',\n",
       " b\"I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.\",\n",
       " b'THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The Decline of Western Civilization......what a great title eh? And of coarse a great movie. This is the best concert film I have ever seen. A close second being the Talking Heads movie \"Stop Making Sense\". I first heard of this movie when Waynes World came out in 1992. I looked at the director\\'s name Penelope Spheeris and thought cool name, what else has he directed? I thought the first name was pronounced like envelope. After some time looking in movie guides I came across the critically acclaimed Decline and realized Penelope was a woman.....my Mom corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down. I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently reside. It was worth the wait. This captures the LA punk movement very well. This is teen angst at it\\'s best folks. My favourite is the band the Germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because Darby Crash sings so crazy, you cannot understand it. I laughed when I saw this. The band Black Flag live in an abandoned church and the band X are a very intelligent bunch. Also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in! I became a huge Penelope Spheeris fan after this, and saw all her punk movies-Dudes was OK, and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both of these on VHS. She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff. I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. I was a big Nirvana fan then, but alas I saw this in 2002 and by that point I had grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method/Fatboy Slim. Quite a change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. This is a tough movie to track down, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don\\'t like the music it is an excellent piece of work. Now days it might be easier to find with DVD\\'s being so popular. By the way Penelope produced a little known Albert Brooks movie called \"Real Life\" which I also own. Very funny stuff in todays reality TV craptacular! Rent Decline......Highly recommended! Thanks!',\n",
       " b\"To surmise, this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to con a gangster. The plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout. However this normally shouldn't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this. There are some genuinely funny bits (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie. Caine's character seemed overdone to me. Especially at the start, he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. One could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny. Overall I would say see only if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise wait for video or tv.\",\n",
       " b\"Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films, because his characters were more central to the plots, but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view.  Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is up for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem.  One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed, but Amos has put her into a cage like apparatus (which Charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device, and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital, but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to cater to Amos, and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital.  Amos' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner, delivering the eulogy at the burial service (the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy). However she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite amusing, and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau, it led to a television series as well.\",\n",
       " b\"This is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the Dead End Kids. Most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop who has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. May Robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough New York cop?).  Busby Berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. The ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but I still found this a highly enjoyable experience.\",\n",
       " b'\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.  It\\'s directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual \"good wife\" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player. The film\\'s baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what\\'s going to happen to him.   It breaks away from the usual run-of-the-mill actioners such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is definetly one of the best actioners in years. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4/10.',\n",
       " b\"Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.  Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.  I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer. When you have only a donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards showing United States as a land with milk rivers and huge vegetables, makes such an impression.  NUOVOMONDO is really a must-see film. It balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, glances' play, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character Lucy/Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, the procedures at Ellis Island). There's a mixed cast, going from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato, till a bitter and smashing Aurora Quattrocchi as the mother. But was it really so hard to enter in the New World?\",\n",

Just stop making movies all together...you are one of the reasons it is so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big.

I like the Billy put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV skit. Not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. Touching and intertaining, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy, and how the streets change.

       " b'As other reviews have said, another of the countless number of Alien clones, this time with a great wodge of The Terminator thrown in, add a bit of the classic SF Story \"Who Goes There?\", and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from The Andromeda Strain (apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer \\'droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them).  OK, the story: after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption.   \"25 years later\".   The crew of a relay station orbiting Mars, due to be relieved in 48 hours, detect a ginormous space ship on a collision course. It\\'s The Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. Not a good time to have taken everything useful off-line on the relay station to do some repairs then. The approaching ship doesn\\'t deviate from its course and is broadcasting a \"Do NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES Enter This Ship!\" warning. After a lot of shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time. But the ship changes course and rams them any way - impaling one of the crew on a stick-outy pointy crew impaler thing. The satellite starts to \"loose integrity\". Bits de-pressurise. Lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked out backwards?).   After a few keystrokes the wheelchair bound techy (who is called \\'Wheeler\\' - the only only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that the Siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines. They all go on-board and take their helmets off. \"Do NOT Enter This Ship!\" obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. One team head for the Main Computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an American Express card but turns out to be a minidisc. The other team find some switches. Amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien. They switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode. A spooky Point of View Shot starts killing people. There\\'s some guff about the Siberia having discovered an new ore, a petential power source worth millions, which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking noises on the soundtrack. Unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted.  After that it\\'s all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths. Just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie. Other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on-board computer (not that the low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start). If the Killer Droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn\\'t it turn off the \"Do NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES Enter This Ship!\" warning signal.. I\\'m sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling GO AWAY! was not a good way of going about it.  Musetta Vander is the only person who gets to do any acting - everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other. It that sort of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off, or get wet while not wearing a lot. Unfortunately it didn\\'t. One of the things wrong with this movie (apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever) is that there was no gratuitous nudity.',\n",

The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are perplexing but welcome mile-markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman downstairs. It\\'s not necessarily an easy film to watch (although it\\'s not heavy-handed by any means), so I\\'d warn any casual viewers who are looking for some \"indie\" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you\\'d like to know something about isolation among city-dwellers in Taiwan, and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning, then watch this film immediately.',\n",
       " b'This is a quiet movie. It\\'s a simple story about a writer who cannot write his story coming back to his home town to get started but instead he gets involved in a friendship with a weird older man whose life externally represents perhaps the internal state of the writer - it\\'s a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and \"useless\" people.  There are no extraordinary circumstances or any big movements in the plot. It\\'s a movie about internal changes. Being stuck in their lives which are not developing much, the principal personages get to help each other to transform, stop leaving in dreams and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction.  On the film-making side I can think of only one weakness which could also be considered as a feature - we do not get much of characters description or inner world insights. It\\'s very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their true feelings which are rather hidden but still you can see them, and this is what makes your own mind work, trying to figure them out, to understand the impressions made by those people, and it\\'s not empty underneath - the actors definitely hold well some inner states proper to their characters. It\\'s close to the real life where you mostly never know someone well enough to understand them completely, and this turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices.  What\\'s most important for me is that this simple almost flat story leaves you pondering afterwards, about your own life, about your own dreams and achievements, are there any or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures, leaving at 100% or only dreaming about it, could we do more and move somewhere we\\'d rather like to be than just leaving feed ourselves and others the tales like \"I\\'ll do this one day\"- not moving one finger to make this actually happen, or \"I\\'m fine where I am\" because it\\'s easier to go by the habits than to actually make a change? At least that\\'s the impression it left me with and it was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation of this far-from-famous movie. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies meant for the heart but those who need events and actions should stay away.',\n",
       " b'Robert Aldrich\\'s brutal, quasi-black comedy \"The Grissom Gang\", a reworking of the 1948 British film \"No Orchids For Miss Blandish\", has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they\\'re onto her. Eventually she just gives up trying, and therein lies the trouble with the story. Are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her? Is her growing concern for the family half-wit supposed to be heartwarming? These are disgusting, cretinous characters, and I wanted to see as little of them as possible. But since the side-stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy-singer Connie Stevens) are rather dull, the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us. Pretty soon, nervous Darby starts sweating too, although her scene up in the hayloft is sensitively performed and Aldrich\\'s climactic moments are thought-provoking, if disorganized. ** from ****',\n",

As the story progresses, the reasoning for the choice of two sisters, to take care of their father, is questionable but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman comes. There may be a question on why the French woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed. The feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from France is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before. It provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.',\n",

When I first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, I thought it was all out hilarious! Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look. The all-time funniest part is when Madonna(Nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne(Louden)trips and falls at the apartment interview scene. **ALANiS Rocks**. Madonna\\'s character Nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time. \"Didn\\'t rob nothin\\', when you rob a store you stick up the cashier. We busted a few tapes, there\\'s a bit of a difference\" I love that!!! It\\'s classic. ***ALANiS Rocks***. I don\\'t know why this movie got slammed the way it did.

I cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like \"it\\'s possible\" verses \"what a stupid video game\" (like the Matrix)  This movie isn\\'t brain surgery, it\\'s very straight forward. Some things are predictable- like knowing that someone is going to be a back-stabber and that someone early on is going to die. Pretty obvious, but SO WHAT? The first 15 minutes sets up our reason, our motive, our main objective.  I like that Theron and Walhberg didn\\'t have any make-out scenes. I am glad that they didn\\'t go there. They kept it about funny dialogue ESPECIALLY SETH GREENE. That guy IS FUNNY!  This is a movie that I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It\\'s fun, fast and entertaining.

At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.  The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who got killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.  As for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background, neither moving forward or back.  I kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order, the acting and dialog would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, it never happened.',\n",

But that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. This group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier, and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. Oh I get it, this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm....while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, this just didn't work. What was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? I found that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation that I had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. While the acting was good, and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well, the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. A bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents.  This movie is not scary, and while I can appreciate the story, perhaps have even enjoyed it if I had read it instead of watched it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurately called Wicked Little Turd.\",\n",
       " b\"Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks. Their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist.  Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance. Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  The film's dialogue is natural, real to life. The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. Daphne is intelligent, yet clearly still an eighteen year old. Buddy may be middle-aged, but still not the hackneyed na\\xc3\\xafve type normally depicted in film. Daphne and Buddy's conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life, but is still comical at the right times. Although the general mood is very relaxed, the dialogue has its own vivacity, forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character's conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities.  The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters. Even existing independently from the film, the compilation truly expresses You Are Alone's central theme-- loneliness.  You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken. Definitely worth seeing\\xc2\\x85 it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.\",\n",

I agree, why were no other rescues boats around and helicopters? The one that rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat that Michael Caine & Sally Field are on. THAT WAS THE ONLY RESCUE CREW? Hard to believe.  The acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap. I really hated the waste of talent from some good actors.

       " b\"Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life. In fact, upon seeing Tadzio, the 'Solitary,' as Mann sometimes calls him, splits in two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year old boy, then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art - a 'divine' work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2, emerges as a stalker who takes control of, then replaces, the rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual-doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and thus Tadzio remains a far-off ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late; the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist. That Venice is gripped by disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers beneath his breath 'I love you,' he knows that all is lost, and the abyss awaits. Is any of this filmable? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. But there are errors: He and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as sympathetic; Mann, again, did not. Aschenbach's POV dominates the film and we are expected to identify. But nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within. Bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease - but what's underneath? Bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. Mann writes a character who is, in his imagination, doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites, yet unable, unwilling to resist. Also, Visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach's - to dramatize Mann's discussion of Art and Artists. These scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor who portrays Alfred is difficult to watch. Also, Visconti's Aschenbach is a Gilded-Age Teutonic composer, which I think works for the film; and the symphonies of Mahler substitute for Aschenbach's novels. Mahler's great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played. So Death in Venice, as Visconti hands it to us, is not the complete success it might have been, but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied. All students of film, especially cinematography, will want to take a look.\",\n",
       " b\"This film, Blade Master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. Ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. He goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. I would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like Conan the barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite brainless. It doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is Conan, but it gives Ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. Zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if Ator seems way too fit for the task to loose.   What gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. The fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did Ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating Ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been.   If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed. I suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems.\",\n",

       " b'I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with, in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything resembling a \"classical\" interpretation of the text.  What I have found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music, I find that in films such as this, the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.  Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat, and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd, since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.  Interestingly enough, I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.  I do not say that this is a bad film, but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks, but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake.',\n",

Sure it has an interesting cast of characters, but I don't think I've ever seen a more cardboard performance from an entire cast as in this uniquely crappy piece of crap. That director ought to be punished somehow for not eliciting at least some kind of performance out of these people. So detachment is a theme, (no really, they'll beat you over the head with this one), it doesn't mean every character has to recite their lines as if they on NPR. Did I mention this movie was crappy? Lastly I'm not sure what connection one's memories would have with terminal bone cancer, but I'm reasonably certain if you were totally brain dead your cancer would continue to grow regardless. This movie is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals, and non-retarded people. Oh, and lastly, bumblebees fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings just like every other flying insect. I absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact. Next time do a little research before using an imbecilic misconception as a premise for an entire freaking movie.

       " b\"Just to correct something in a previous review here, I don't believe this film is only for people who know London, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who, by going though this gruelling Knowledge test, gain some measure of self-knowledge.  I think it's one of the most perfectly-written dramas I've seen: technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you. At the start you know no more about this London Knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's vitally important to you. You become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed, and you are crushed for those who don't. Especially one whose downfall, without giving anything anyway, will make your hands fly to your face.  Also just as a point of fact, Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr Burgess, is called the Vampire, not Dracula. You don't need to know this, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this, you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail.  I hope you get to see it.  William\",\n",

You, the Living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as Songs, replete with black humor, surreal situations, and strange looking characters. Though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work, what remains constant is Andersson\\'s unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile-looking backgrounds, and precise attention to detail. If there is a theme that ties the sketches together, it is that our time on Earth is limited and \"tomorrow\\'s another day\\', so let\\'s treat each other with kindness. Along the way, we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the Louisiana Brass Band, dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song, and a house that turns into a moving train.  The emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an Alzheimer\\'s patient to a young woman\\'s ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar-player named Micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers. While there is no continuous narrative thread, the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches. The first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench, the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her, yet she blithely ignores the man\\'s comforting and reassuring words.  There is also a hefty admixture of irony. During what seems to be an executive luncheon, one man tells another on the phone that workers don\\'t appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine. When he is not looking, however, a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair. Though Andersson\\'s cynicism is at times not very well hidden, You the Living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. It is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around, if we heed the warning of the poet Goethe that opens the film, \"Be pleased then, you the living, in your delightfully warmed bed, before Lethe\\'s ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot.\"',\n",
       " b'Let me just say that GRANNY was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves!!!!!! the best indie horror movie I have ever seen that is only 58 minutes long...It is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time. You people should love this. I give it a 10 out of 10!!!',\n",
       " b'This happened to be just starting on TV when I opened it, and as I felt too lazy to change the channel, I ended up watching it. Man, was that fortunate.  This film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, and at times openly sentimental one. It is definitely what one could call a feel-good movie, and I usually find such either boring or irritating. Yet this film is so very well done I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; it is conventional, but flawless. The actors are brilliant, every single one is a perfect fit for the role. There is not much of a score, but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifully.  If you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or saving the world in a movie, do watch this if you ever have the chance. 5/5',\n",
       " b\"Wow, I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.  Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk, another great Lillard film.  Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)  It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.  The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.\",\n",
       " b\"The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good. Her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness. (The real life family that Macdonald based the Kettles upon, successfully sued...claiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less-than-flattering references). Sure, it's comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun moments...and political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could've still written these characters more sensibly and Universal International could've had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity (there's such a thing as good taste). The more realistic moments are when the oldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. For their part, the Kettles have to realize that they don't exactly fit into a modern world. That's not a joke...that's a sober truth.\",\n",
       " b'Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. Sound like anyone you know?  From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe\\'s civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.  The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.  In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All this does is to humanise him. When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As dictator, he inspects his subordinates\\' technical innovations which don\\'t work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact, Hynkel\\'s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.  In truth, Chaplin\\'s day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer\\'s face, \"your cause is doomed to failure because it\\'s built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people\"? And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of \\'silent\\' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).  Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. \"Gee, ain\\'t I cute?\" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over. Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn\\'t come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature. The \\'wouldn\\'t it be wonderful?\\' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.  Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film\\'s underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.  And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?',\n",
       " b\"A huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track. I can't say it was riveting entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless I enjoyed the film - it provided the escape I was after one afternoon. A good look for those of us looking for the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some corny moments, few thrills, and an occasional laugh.\",\n",
       " b'This movie is scary at times, perhaps no more so than when a naked George Kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar. Thankfully his nakedness is covered by a blanket, but the image is still more horrifying than anything you\\'re likely to find in, for example, Schindler\\'s List.  The dialog in this film was inspiring; it inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a stewardess remarks about male pilots, Kennedy asks, \"Why do you think it\\'s called a \\'cock\\' pit?\" Charming.  And yes, contrary to what some have written, this film is very, very bad.',\n",
       " b\"Necessary Roughness (1991) was a bad comedy/ drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football. A lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. Other than that it's a very mediocre movie. They should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism. Instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. When will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic?  Not recommended, unless it's for free on t.v.\",\n",
       " b'I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. My friends and I are fans of HK film, but WOW. This movie has it all, and by all I mean everything a movie shouldn\\'t have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, way over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfunny \"gags\" and \"jokes\", elementary school premise, mindless killings, and too-long running time for the material. Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you\\'re entertaining the idea of watching this film...don\\'t.',\n",
       " b'My wife and I watched this abortion from its beginning. I hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of years.For me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features. My wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether. Occasionally I catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfing.There is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful. There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind. That was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it- no humour. The writers seem to have no idea about drama - they seem to think conflict IS drama, and of course that is only one element of it. Light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it. I am sure the actors in Eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with. It must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz. I fail to understand why the British public watch it and love it. What on earth does it say about our psyche? I have heard it said that it is \"just like real life\"-its nothing like my life or anyone\\'s life I know, otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport. The themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown pre-watershed. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire but I would not expect to see them at 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. The programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost.',\n",
       " b\"I give this piece of Hollywood trash 1 out 10! Seriously! I mean, I like comedy as much as the next guy. I also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it. But this film had nothing to laugh at OR with.  I like nearly all of the actors in this film. So I thought I'd overlook what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). I was just mortified at how stupid this script was! Just ridiculous and not even in a funny way. The only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on TV. I was very disappointed and I really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it! Bad decision on their parts...  *********************MAJOR SPOILER************************  Okay - here's my biggest question on this film.......If the characters are looking back on this story of Jewel (Liv Tyler) after the fact....then how can Paul Reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster!!!! Can anyone answer me that?!?!?!?!? Major goof on the part of the film makers.....Nobody noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!\",\n",
       " b'The first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot exposition -- after an early brief sequence of Las Vegas being hit by tornadoes, the action doesn\\'t really start until the second two hours. Still, some character relationships don\\'t become clear until the second part. The actors turn in competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those in \"Aftershock: Earthquake in New York\"). An exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of \"Independence Day\", \"Speed\", \"The Day After Tomorrow\", \"Earthquake\", \"The Towering Inferno\" and several other films. You can predict what will happen next, and come close to predicting the dialog, word for word. The special effects are unbelievably bad. Despite the effects in \"Twister\", the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as \"CSI\" and \"Cold Case\" spend on the totality of a single episode. If you have to see a made-for-TV disaster film, see \"The Day After\", \"Asteroid\", or \"Special Bulletin\" instead -- you\\'ll get better plots, acting, and effects.',\n",
       " b'\"Dead Man Walking\" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.  Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was very well-deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job in \"Leaving Las Vegas\", I would have been happier if Penn had won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Academy Award she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I have given this film: 9/10!',\n",
       " b\"Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who Mrs Payton is desiring to blow the joint with. There is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that Burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the Payton tramp. I watched this only part way through because its really awful, so didn't even get to see the star of the show---which I guess is a gorilla that the voo-doo hag turned someone into or whatever.....who cares. I give this one half star out of a possible ten. It's not even campy, just really bad.\",\n",

My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place. Watch this film with your family it is a great movie. I also recommend the book in both French and English. Go Habs Go.\",\n",
       " b\"It's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! This is one that I've watched, with pulse quickening every time, at least a dozen times.  Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. Those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it.  This was a fun ADVENTURE. Sort of like The Little Rascals if they just had to be serious.\",\n",
       " b'Having some idle time before going to work, I looked at my \"50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics\" DVD collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: Zis Boom Bah starring a forgotten Grace Hayes. \"Classics\" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles I\\'ve never heard of and I suspect they\\'re all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie also stars her son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (who I just found out is a New Orleans native from the state I live in, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as a malt shop proprietor and Huntz Hall, taking a break from the East Side Kids, as Peter\\'s buddy. The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn\\'t have many funny scenes though I did like Peter\\'s celebrity impersonations and his dance with Hall in drag. And the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. Rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though I did like his funny dance). Since this was only 61 minutes that I\\'m sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill, I\\'ll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that I mentioned enjoying.',\n",
       " b'This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely. Christie\\'s books tend to move at a gentle, sometimes even sedate pace, and \"Evans\" is one that certainly does. It also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, which results in a very slow, involved story. As a Christie fan, I gave it 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the BBC did for its later Christie productions much more.  In the end, this movie is a leisurely pleasure, highlighted by the breathy waif Francesca Annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off James Warwick very well.',\n",
       " b\"Oh how awfully this movie is! I don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! The story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat. But this movie makes me grab a pillow, lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll...  Boring! Not worth watching! I tell you, this movie sucked!  1/10\",\n",
       " b\"When you're watching Distant you know you're not watching a French movie, there's little sex and it's mostly elliptical and people don't talk that much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations, just to let you make sense of what's going on. It doesn't look American either, there aren't any car chases or shoot-outs or violence, unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe. At times, the relatively long-held medium-distance shots may remind you of 'contemplative' Asian cinema, but just reminds you, the director doesn't push things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers but then again, this is not a Taiwanese movie, it's a Turkish movie. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if that's supposed to mean something.  The movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet, those few lines, those somewhat long-held shots and that often mitigated tension gradually build a sense of something happening, a sense of 'plot', for lack of a better word, that grows on you. By the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart.\",\n",
       " b\"Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?  The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn. While this was Warn's first feature length film, the movie doesn't reflect that at all, but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would definitely love to see more of her work.  Being based on riddles, this is a very cerebral movie. It's that's your thing, as it is mine, then I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5/5\",\n",
       " b\"A stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in Japan, Like Grains of Sand delves into issues such as rape, homosexuality and pubescent angst in a subtle and significant way. It gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the bounds of their parent's generation, with it's strict conformity and facade. Typical to Japanese cinema, often what isn't said is more important that what is, so to those not versed in Japanese film and culture, beware. It can seem dull and minimalistic (pretty much like every film to come out of Japan bar Mangas) if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and was what originally sparked my interest in Japan, it's culture and language. Considering I'm now 22 and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, needless to say it's a powerful film. Enjoy!\",\n",
       " b'This DVD will be treated with indifference by mllions of classic rock music devotees across the world because Rush just aren\\'t cool. It is a shame that Rush have had to overcome sneering disdain from the majority of North American and British music journalists over their thirty odd year history as this has deprived many people the chance to get into a real band.Each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a catalogue of songs it is! We have the seminal \"2112\", the magical \"The Trees\" and the lyrical \"Tom Sawyer\" interspersed with the high-energy, genre-challenging pieces from their latest album \"Vapor Trails.\" The musicianship is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are just plain crazy (at one point they sing along to an instrumental!)Each band member plays at a level that defies belief-real craftsmen performing art.If you doubt this try out the instrumentals \"La Villa Strangiato\" or \"The Rhythm Method\" for size-and yes the latter is a drum solo (which has to be seen to be believed.)  Sound and vision production values are very high as befits the Rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi-angled set pieces to boot.  This is an astonishing performance and tribute to the Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy.',\n",
       " b'Everyone I know loves this movie, but I am afraid that I don\\'t. I hated this film so much that I had to turn it off mid-film because of the repulsion. Way too much time is spent on weepiness and emotional bedlam, the point of the Bullock character being devastated by her divorce is jackhammered into the viewer\\'s head excessively. Enough already!! And why didn\\'t we hear more about her ex-husband? He is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while. Something must of made her want to marry him, what was it? What is it about him that makes her so devastated upon their divorce? More time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of Bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is stilted, cliched and terrible, much like one of those corny \"ABC Afterschool Specials\" or something. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film, it is all very predictable and therefore boring. This movie also goes into overdrive on the cutsiness factor, very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be! This is just another one of those horribly done \"I am woman, hear me roar\" films, much like \"Waiting To Exhale\". If you want to see \"I am woman, hear me roar\" films that are truly entertaining, original and well-done, then see \"Gas Food Lodging\" or \"Ruby in Paradise\". Skip this crap!! I give \"Hope Floats\" 3/10.',\n",
       " b'Although it has been off the air for 6 years now, Promised Land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation. Good cast, supporting cast(among them, Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is believable with McRaney packing up his family and just saying \"to hell with it all\" after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnam years earlier. I think a lot of Vietnam-era veterans, myself included, could really relate to McRaney\\'s thought process in finally deciding on his course of action. Many of us did precisely the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and finding that America was not the same place we left. The show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life. In those two respects alone, I think it is one of the more poignant TV series of our time. Why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me.',\n",
       " b'What often gets overlooked in Agatha Christie\\'s stories is her progressive, anti-conservative attitude on a number of issues - from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people\\'s belief in the supernatural. In \"Nemesis\", you can spot a lot of those subtexts - but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. Also lifting \"Nemesis\" above other series entries (\"They Do It With Mirrors\", \"4:50 From Paddington\", etc.), is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense. And finally, Jane Booker is welcome to guard my body any time. (***)',\n",
       " b\"I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.  The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the training of the disciples of the Shaolin monks killed by Abbot white, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. Whilst we are treated to the punishing training sequences the two young avengers must go through to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique needed to defeat Abbot White's invincible armour technique, we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape...mostly using Taoist magic to extract the blood from naked ladies. We all know how this is going to end, but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting sick of martial arts movies, and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies. This movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls to the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained. Visit your local Beewise today!  \",\n",

But that excitement soon turned to horror, this movie is a complete failure, it just try\\'s to hard to be funny that its sad, the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it...  The only good acting in the whole movie was from Stefan C.

I would not Recommend this movie to any one, because it try\\'s to hard and never really delivers.',\n",
       " b'Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been Laura Hope Crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in \"Camille\" (1936) and her best remembered role is Aunt Pittypat in \"Gone With the Wind\".  Irene Dunne was the \"official\" star of the film but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamite.  David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Centre. Their first stop in America is a visit to David\\'s mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is an under-statement. From her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her \"big boy\" - all attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets Hester\\'s existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(Hester has been living there for a while.)  Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.  All the young cast are excellent. Eric Linden is superb as Robert, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother\\'s spell. Joel McCrea, at one point says \"painting roses on bathtubs - that\\'s more your style\". There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Robert\\'s sexuality.  Irene Dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.',\n",
       " b'Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I do try. This was a film that I tried and hated. Worst of all, after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I saw characters too outrageous for \"Eastenders\" being paraded as realistic.  Clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter. Aim high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offers to hire Clint if he gets a pair of shoes.  Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wander the whole of England trying to get him some shoes. Eventually, they end up at a suburban home. Whose isn\\'t clear. Mum helps a girl shoot up. Oh, now THERE\\'S some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha tie off and find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis tunes and then chases the kids away.  Why didn\\'t Clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store? Why didn\\'t he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help? Why didn\\'t he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? I just don\\'t know! None of these things seemed to be beneath him. Benevolent groups, like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have stores to help people. I know people who work there! If someone with no money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot covering. Not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the underprivileged, but shoes are usually no problem. What a dumb concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, simply isn\\'t that cruel. In England, maybe it\\'s from \"The Queen\\'s Royal Charity\" rather than Goodwill, but people who need shoes do get them.  Aside from the quest for shoes, there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action. Not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable, mind you. Despite checking the tape jacket several times, I was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it only seemed that way.  Did Clint get his shoes? Did the cardboard cutout of Brad Dourif hire him at the restaurant? Did I ever watch anything else foreign ever again?  [spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes.  As for the fate of this particular film, I decided to end it all. I took out my S&W .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store, and amazingly NO ONE EVER CALLED TO ASK ABOUT IT!!! Meaning, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something that I didn\\'t. Live and learn.  BTW, if you rent something you\\'ve never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it, take it as a sign. And if you work at the Kroger video department, I\\'m just kidding.  Footnote: this classic has yet to see the light of day on DVD, for which we should be eternally thankful to the digital gods.',\n",

The movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me.  I know once again that IMDb is going to make me write ten more lines. But I'm not so sure on what I could say about this movie because I am still trying to figure it out. Silly, isn't it?

IF this is what great Eugene O\\'Niell drama is like I never want to be victim to viewing it ever again. There are so many things WRONG w/ this feature where does one begin? First, Elmer Bernstein\\'s bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character\\'s motivations. Second, these characters are NOT pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that I personally disliked every scene in which Ives ate up the scenery, but that was the way his characters was written: to be disliked. W/ Loren it just never is made clear whether she\\'s good or bad \\xc2\\x85 and all her babbling about how she\\'s going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives \\xc2\\x85 well, I saw what was coming clearly. Perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm-up for Norman Bates (which he played two years later) even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end. Hokey! Third, this film is a studio sound-stage production and it suffers because of it. The story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of \"place\" regarding the farm (which all the main leads are fighting over). As it is filmed there\\'s no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound-stage feel to it that isn\\'t convincing. This is a really awful film.',\n",
       " b\"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina.   The acting is pathetic. I know acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people act is like watching Michael J. Fox perform brain surgery. It's shaky at best.   One of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of Dan Gordon as Chris. Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting.   The special effects in this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box. Sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top, but it didn't help. I suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 80s.\",\n",

Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense just wasn't there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen. Fortunately the movie was on TV and so I didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film! I honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. It's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash! I guess the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.\",\n",

It was amazingly well-balanced, showing each side\\'s perspective and leaving many questions unanswered. This is as it should be. I don\\'t watch a documentary to be told what to think. I watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions.  Afterward, we took a trip to Waco and visited the Branch Davidians at the site of the conflagration.

If they would have gotten more money, a little better actors(but these ones were intimidating so it was good) and a little more detailed script this movie would be terrific.

       " b'Two escaped convicts step out of the woods and shoot two campers in the head. That\\'s the first scene, and it made me wince, fearing what was in store. But by the end of the first half hour I was all swept up in the flood of images. Not because I cared in the least about any of the characters but because I was aghast at how execrable the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink.  Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are the ex-inmates. After murdering the two innocent campers they plow through the woods and wangle their way into the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, the attorney Keith and the estranged homosexual Behr. The escapees at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone, but they gradually reveal their identities.  Well, it looks like familiar territory so far. \"Desperate Hours,\" or \"Funny Games\" maybe. But -- hang on -- the gay son is in cahoots with the two. It seems that Stockwell, upon discovering his son in flagrante delicto with another man named Billy, kicked Billy around and threw him out. Billy went on to die and Behr now blames his Dad for the death. And, indeed, Dad is something of a Neanderthal when it comes to paraphilias, the fact that he was just found cohabiting with a secretary notwithstanding.  The grief-stricken Behr just searched and searched, looking for someone else who had known Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It turned out to be one of the escapees, and now Behr is determined to see them to their freedom.  It gets all twisted after that. People talk. They talk and talk. They talk continually. And NOT about the two mad killers who just can\\'t wait to put one between their eyes. No -- the dialog goes something like, \"You were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own SON.\" That\\'s Behr, the young gay guy, talking to Stockwell. It\\'s as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its genes mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of transformational device or cocktail shaker.  The only real performance is given by James Remar as the more talkative and ominous of the two escapees. And that\\'s mainly because of his gruff but fluid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson\\'s, and his wide guppy-like lips. He\\'s easy on the eyes and ears.  Dean Stockwell has given decent performances, including his inestimable bizarro turn in \"Blue Velvet,\" in which he was my supporting player, but here laziness, advancing years, or slack direction has shaped his every move and every utterance into a stereotype. It\\'s as if he were reading stage directions -- \"Look surprised\" and \"shout angrily\" -- and following them literally. There\\'s not a surprise in a cartload.  If the gay son, Jason Behr, ever blinked, it must have been while I was blinking at the same time because I missed it. He has a long neck and just one expression in his instrument. Woolvett as the secondary villain fades into the pine-knot paneled woodwork. The attorney son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he didn\\'t quit his day job.  The direction is pedestrian, the staging functional without being in the least innovative. Sometimes it\\'s confusing. I lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are circling around on the cabin\\'s porch and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun. I also couldn\\'t understand how Stockwell could put a blast through the cabin\\'s door, hit Remar, and knock him in a back flip off the porch, and then Remar could simply stand up, dust himself off, and come up with a cranky riposte like, \"Okay. Two can play that game.\" But why go on? See it if you must.',\n",
       " b'George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script - with the usual good RKO cast around. It\\'s a non-Charteris story too, bristling with murders and good clean fun.  Thread 1: In New York, Police Inspector Fernack, Templar\\'s friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced - ST comes over from London to try to put things right. Nice and simple so far - but is there really more than $90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the Saint fall in love with her to boot. Including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in Fernack\\'s cellar - there\\'s a creepy shot of him (dead and staring) and them in a car when they\\'re taking him back to where they\\'d got him. Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this - witness the dressing gown at the beginning, and the later beguiling comment by ST that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet - and did too for \"Palm Springs\"! Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from Templar to liven him up.  The Hays Office also made sure you got the picture right, all threads are tied up with no straggly bits. Well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer\\'s version is your yardstick then don\\'t bother.',\n",
       " b\"This was an attempt toward a romantic comedy, and one which did not work. Although the film was cast in an interesting manner, the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all.

What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.

       " b'Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off. Look at the films of Blake Edwards, who is arguably the master of the genre, and you will find just as many misses as hits. For, if a film of this nature ever fails to work, it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a teen sex comedy [i.e. \"American Pie\"], or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [i.e. Julia Roberts\\' entire career]. It can only maintain a push to the end, and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of it\\'s resolution.  Written by husband/wife team Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, \"Seeing Other People\" opens with engaged couple Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson] only seconds away from rear-ending the car in front of them. As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here on out, we welcome that the story about to unfold will enjoy a point of view from both sexes.  Two months shy of their vows, Ed & Alice already look and act like an old married couple. In an early bathroom scene, their actions alone show us just how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. So when the line to propel the plot forward is uttered - expectedly from the least likely of the two - it is as if the very relationship itself is calling for a change, even if it means it\\'s own destruction.  Once all the ground rules are set [Ed can not sleep with her mother or, for that matter, Salma Hayek], the two head off in their separate directions in the hope of finding some meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship. At first, everything seems to go as planned as their daily trysts only help to fire up the passion between them. But predictably, as the deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves growing apart and on the verge of breaking up. All of these actions leading to a resolution you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism.  For a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with supporting characters just as strong as the leads. And director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he has cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and allows them to play to their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she brings an air of naivete and vulnerability to Alice even when her actions seems less than so. And as for Graham, an actress who has proven she could outperform an entire Howard Hawks ensemble, she steals every scene she is in with an edgy \"no BS\" persona.   As for the guys, Jay Mohr is serviceable here as is Josh Charles. \"Malcolm in the Middle\"\\'s Byron Cranston has to be applauded for taking on a British accent and letting it all hang out. But the real treat here is Andy Richter and his sub-plot involving single mother, Helen Slater. While his scenes almost seem to belong in another movie, they are by far the funniest and his dead panned delivery steals the show.  For an independent production, \"Seeing Other People\" has a more personal and introspective feeling - something that would be noticeable absent from a big Hollywood film of this kind. Not to mention that this film also has some genuinely funny moments - unlike, say, most Hollywood comedies in general.  Rating [on a 5 star system] : 3 1/2 stars',\n",
       " b'Oh,God! Book II is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it.It is not all that funny,its plot plays too much  like a rejected situation comedy pilot,and the use of the slogan \"Think God\" is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original.John Denver had not returned for this movie and that made a BIG difference.George Burns,as  wonderful as he was playing God,does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with John Denver.  I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10,but only for  George Burns;the rest of the cast is nothing special.  If you loved the first one,don\\'t bother to see this one.',\n",
       " b\"'This Is Not a Film' works because it is so true in what it is trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message, you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether male or female, all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. Did it really occur like we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out. But even so, he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We would not be in them otherwise. As the film ends, I am not sure if Michael has learned anything new about himself or not. Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story. I found Michael to be pompous, arrogant, and just plain clueless. Which is exactly why I liked him. He is a real character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is a film for you. In closing, it is a film for everyone.\",\n",
       " b\"Unlike one of the reviewers below, I don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. Whereas it is good to see a British director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which, granted, is very hard to do), you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script. The audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. To sum up: the Emperor's New Clothes. And a rather poor outfit, too.\",\n",
       " b'When, oh, when will someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground release this on widescreen DVD??? Le Orme, which I only know because of my rare/vintage video collecting habit, is a film in my collection that I would not only sit through, but actually enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is top billed, but is only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Though several comments expressed disappointment in his rather limited screen time.) I cannot say that this is a good horror film, a good mystery, a sci-fi epic or anything of that nature. It is simply unclassifiable in the \"genre\" sense of things. It is more like a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream, filled with great visuals and mystery. It relies on visuals and emotion, much like Bava\\'s \"Lisa and the Devil\". Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but almost impossible to describe in a logical manner; they both occur in such a dream-like atmosphere. Don\\'t be deterred by Force Video\\'s synopsis on the back cover. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Though Force Video\\'s release from 1986 (the only one in the US, that I know of) is cropped to full-screen on tape, even in that format it is still great. Releasing it remastered and/or letterboxed would make it magnificent (hint, hint... DVD companies).',\n",

A wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney\\'s eight-year-old daughter. From there, it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl.

       " b'Set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it\\'s a story of madness. The landscape may be quite picturesque, but there\\'s madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person kills little children.  In style and tone this film resembles Dario Argento\\'s famous Italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that Argento\\'s films are much better looking. Still, the visuals in Fulci\\'s \"Don\\'t Torture A Duckling\" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the \"ducklings\" is vulnerably alone.  In one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. But this is no slasher film. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic.  Plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn\\'t assume an agenda on the part of the director. Don\\'t dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the end provides good misdirection. However, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The film\\'s finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer\\'s mindset.  I don\\'t care for the film\\'s widescreen projection. But background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it\\'s a bit overdone.  Though not as visually brilliant as Argento\\'s giallos, \"Don\\'t Torture A Duckling\" nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.',\n",
       " b\"I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. The performances are strong, particularly Maureen Carr as the mother, Trise. I understand the film has recently been released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, which is why I gave it a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing achievement.\",\n",
       " b'having never actually seen anything by this beloved of the luvvies, let alone a production of merchant of venice, i cant comment on how faithful it is to previous adaptations of the play so i will treat it as just another movie that tries to be more than novocaine for the eye MoV is an instantly gripping movie about a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his merchant friend antonio (irons) and a Jewish money lender shylock (pacino)  plot summary  bassiano is broke and needs money to woo the lovely portia (collins), he goes to his friend antonio, who sypathises with his friends predicament, so borrows some money off shylock  now antonio does not like jews in general and shylock in particular and shylock bitter and twisted from the abuse he has suffered from antonio in particular and christians in general agrees to lend antonio the money on condition that if antonio does not repay the loan by the agreed deadline, shylock will cut a pound of flesh from antonios body   comment  the movie is breathtakingly beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way as to force you to think about what each line means, this in turn causes the viewer to gain insights into the characters and their motivations  it seems to me to be a movie about the choices that shylock makes, and how making wrong choices leads to shylocks ruin  from the moment shylock demands his pound of flesh he is doomed, for rest of the world is against him and connives to bring about his downfall  this disturbed me greatly, normally in a movie when a victim gets a chance of revenge against those who have harmed him either the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error of his ways leading to a big hug  not in MoV the victim quickly becomes seen as the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith  this movie is a powerful and subtle portrayal of casual anti semitism which shows how a whole society can turn on a minority and make it seem like the victim is really the offender  i was blown away by this movie 10/10',\n",
       " b\"I purchased this DVD recently and I was totally awed that Rush's songs sound the same as they did when I first listened to them in 1980. The lineup of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want to listed to them play again and again.  Songs I remember like Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight, and The Spirit of Radio were played and the 40000 plus fans there singing along and having a great time and I swear over half the audience was under 25!  Writers who put down Rush as far as Rush fans like myself are concerned are a bunch of jealous dunderheads who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco.  Rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync,wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member brag about how long they have been unmarried. All they do is entertain!  I give this DVD a 100 out of 100.\",\n",
       " b'Let us assume for a moment that you haven\\'t experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and you\\'re wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out\\xc2\\x85 Well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of The Beguiled. See, with film you have your clean trips (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky), whack trips, i.e. the experience-from-which-you-never-recover (Sweet Movie and El Topo), and you\\'re bad organic trips, a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the Times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English refer to as \"hallucinogenic in tone.\" By the third act of this Don Siegel directed movie, you may not exactly observe that your two lead-heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal, nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age, but you will feel something.  In 1970, when this film was filmed, most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain, a movie like The Graduate perhaps, a lot of world-endism was going on and, of course you had the nightmare break down of war in Vietnam. What you get with The Beguiled, banal drug metaphors aside, is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of Sam Peckinpah. In the Beguiled, Donny Siegel, born in 12, Chicago, Il., less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970\\'s in the form of a classical film artifact. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: the shooting, editing, direction and story are all fantastic, and you\\'re not likely to see anything else like it. Undoubtedly, a sinister film, its effects, as I\\'ve said, both dizzying and adulterating; frankly it\\'s hard to believe would ever Universal attached its name to this picture, but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet, sweet camera moves, and cinematographer Bruce Surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the American Plantation South, conflating beauty with evil in every location shot. Clint Eastwood, needless to say, has never been like this. Old Clint, he moves at instant from coy to livid, his eyes like two Archimedean spirals in medium close up. The rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny.  This Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my lifetime, but that doesn\\'t stop me from positing that it\\'s one of the best American synch sound films ever made. While most people catalogue it as a western, to include the folks at The Western Channel, The Beguiled is a problem because you don\\'t really know what it is: A sort of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought Noir films starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man, who likes to kick back with the cheap, gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire, saw that high angle medium long shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around Clint\\'s bloody leg, Pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the Outback Bowl, right before he absconded to another room. My advice: watch this one, and make sure it is on a very large screen, preferably run on that DPL home theater projector you\\'re contemplating. I would put The Beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase, turn the overheads out, throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall, and try not to lose your grip because just like Norman Bates, \"We all go a little mad sometimes,\" even the beguiled.',\n",
       " b'wow...I just watched this movie...American people have this stereotypical view towards Hindi films such as, ALL Indian films have dances, songs and a love story....Its pathetic how far away from the truth that is. This film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of Hindi films. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. And all this by a Hollywood director. Most Indian films today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also cover a variety of different subjects. Just like most other Hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country, where truth is thrown out the window. This is a highly NOT recommended movie. Instead watch good Hindi films like black Friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother India, lagaan...Those films are what real Indian cinema are all about.',\n",
       " b'Two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist. However, the script, the direction, and some scenes, were just awful. I kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie, but knew the movie was filled with flaws.  This film could have been so much better, and reached a larger audience accordingly. What makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film, some scenes being painfully bad to watch, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself.',\n",
       " b\"This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich\\xc3\\xa9, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.  In sitting through this, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.  Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.\",\n",
       " b'I don\\'t understand the humor in this film. I also found it offensive on how Koreans were depicted in that film, despite how it is actually just a caricature of Koreans in those areas. First, the actors are Japanese, and they make the most rude expressions of Koreans in that film. It disgusts me on how these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching that one scene, and how they were so badly made out in the film. The humor lasts just for one laugh, and then you don\\'t understand why it\\'s even funny. It\\'s crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. I found it to be an offensive film overall... Maybe it was just because I never lived in the \"hood\" or saw any \"hood\" movies, but I don\\'t intend to either.',\n",

Fine performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun \"over-the-top\" ones by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside,  and a downright outstanding one from Patrick Swayze. The movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly undercut by it\\'s flashback framing which results in a formulamatic, abrupt ending. \"Father Hood\" would have worked MUCH better without these \"bookends\". Nevertheless, the movie brings up important issues of \"family responsibilities\" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the foster system rewards state institutions for NOT placing children, such abuses will exist.  Pick this one up. It\\'s worth the \"ride.\"',\n",
       " b\"Friz Freleng's 'All Abir-r-r-d' is one of the best Sylvester and Tweety cartoons. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting, 'All Abir-r-r-d' makes the most of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are domestic pets who are being sent unattended across country by train. With both a watchful official and a vicious bulldog to deal with, Sylvester has his work cut out. The Sylvester and Tweety cartoons always benefited from some extra participants and 'All Abir-r-r-d' is a good example of how much these additional characters help. Although they are not especially memorable creations, they throw some more obstacles in Sylvester's path and make for a more interesting battle. This early Sylvester and Tweety short presses many of the right buttons and, while Tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness, there's some deliciously violent antics between Sylvester and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny non-quip by Tweety.\",\n",
       " b\"This has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies. Charles Band made the best movie of 96' in this little seen gem. Highly realistic and , incredibly stylised- with a visual flair David Fincher would envy, its not hard to see why Band went on to make such classics as 'Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil', 'The Regina Pierce Affair', 'Virgins of Sherwood Forest', and 'Timegate: Tales of the Saddle Tramps'.  With a highly sophisticated story- a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women, this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer, but for those who see it, Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. The head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another, and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level. Although many earlier critics have compared Band's film to Re-animator and other lesser works, this stands head and heels above the rest. It is gorier, but not pointlessly. The gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline, rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience. Also, the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch, easily the best work done in a horror film since... well... ever! The work in this film makes Savini's effects look like the work of a blind, limbless hobo.  The only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity, which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal- to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time. If it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10.\",\n",
       " b'Cultural Vandalism Is the new Hallmark production of Gulliver\\'s Travels an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, not a single copy of the book is burned. But if this is the only Gulliver people are exposed to\\xc2\\x97and to many it will be\\xc2\\x97those people will not get anything like what Jonathan Swift intended. Were Jonathan Swift alive, Hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they\\'d lose. That\\'s a good way to think before starting a project using someone else\\'s ideas.  Swift\\'s masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel big, small, shat on and\\xc2\\x85 human. The little people in Lilleput are small in every way. Petty and stupid, they fight, the big-enders and little- enders, interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table. Sounds a bit like us.  I forget most of the rest: it\\'s been years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of a few things and, on the bright side, it made me want to read it again.  This gift to mankind has been shat on, like Gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen and especially two great actors, Peter O\\'Toole and Edward Fox, ought to be thoroughly ashamed. Some \"Creative Person\" got the bright idea to put the focus on \"the star:\" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose acting is just plain bad. He portrays Gulliver as insane. All his travels were made up. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift made up Gulliver! Naturally, the lands he visited were imaginary: that\\'s called fiction. His purpose was to talk about humankind and our, often awful, relations with each other. The travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that Hallmark couldn\\'t turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect.  I can sure see why Hallmark would produce this crap. It\\'s so bad that O\\'Toole, always profound, seems as little as his Lilliputian character. He\\'s in character, of course, while commenting on the character simultaneously, as many, if not all great actors do. Informing the character sheds light on it. Our light completes the character. It becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do this very subtly, like Hopkins in \"The Remains of the Day.\" Others, like Nicholson, in most things in the last twenty years, play the two parts pretty broadly apart. Nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too: with him it\\'s all cat\\'s cradle and he, chuckling away, holds all the strings. Great fun, as is O\\'Toole. But something here is lacking. He is shouting into a megaphone (as great as ever) and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him.  That\\'s because it is. Look up \"anodyne\" and there ought to be the word \"Hallmark\" as a synonym. Harmless, bland, inoffensive: Hallmark is the doll who can\\'t pee because she has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person of no distinction. Hallmark\\'s hallmark is to have no hallmark. I never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much. Suddenly, Pound\\'s \"Disney against the meta-physicals\" stands out in bold type. Or Einstein\\'s \"Men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds.\" Indeed, anyone, to this mediocre type, who has an answer to any question other than \"a)\" or \"b)\" is suspect. Who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at Jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the Classical age and these things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture; the one that feeds and sustains them. And us.  Please buy a copy of Gulliver\\'s Travels wherever you live, and read it. Or order it online. I like to use ABE Books.',\n",

       " b'A raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn\\'t quite attain. I did still enjoy the film immensely. It had great elements of suspense, leaving me with that delightful spine chill I expect from thrillers, and it achieved this purely psychologically, without resorting to escalating blood and gore. The soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly. At times, it was a bit unpolished, particularly the acting, and character development. It could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to seek the \"answer\" that is so integral to the storyline. After all they seemed to continue to seek it, despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it. I would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.',\n",
       " b\"From the golden period of British films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time. Screened yesterday at my Film Society to a rapturous audience, I was astonished at how well the comedy has lasted (made in 1950!). It is really down to the expert timing and inimitable playing from two of the finest actors Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton, this farce is briskly handled by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: A ministry mistake billets a girls' school on a boys' school. I will always laugh when I think of this film.\",\n",
       " b\"I sort of liked this movie, not a good one, but not the worst ever made. Though, everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created, I thought it was okay. There are a lot of immature jokes. It wants to be funny sometimes, but fails.  The story is OKAY. It may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences, though.  The acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is a horrible actor at most times. At some times, it is even laughable. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor in here. He is funny when he is supposed to be, but some of his lines are god awful.  Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he is possessed by the mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. Also, the scenes that he is in are so unfunny, that they are almost unbearable. I am sure they could have cut him out, and it wouldn't affect the movie at all.  Overall, you can live without seeing this. It is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. They definitely could have gone without making the sequel, but it is a decent effort. 4/10\",\n",
       " b\"Fires on the plain directed by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers, but the Japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the Philippines. The main characters name is Tamura , played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. Like this, he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease. But since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed, he begins a long walk. Throughout the whole movie, Tamura remains a bit cowardish, but very civil, when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival Tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade. A scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is, when Tamura comes into a Phillipino village which is completely deserted. There, he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more scared than he already is. That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly. After he turns away from the corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or brother and sister : very close relationship) return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back. The main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first, although he walked up to them with his gun, but shoots the woman once she starts screaming. Her brother/boyfriend/husband then runs away in fear and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After Tamura picks up the bag of salt , something very precious , he drops his gun into a river. This gesture is very important in order to understand Kon Ichikawa's/Shohei Ooka's profiling of Tamura and the war. Comparing this movie to other World War 2 movies, it is not typical at all. Of course all movies have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he is getting manipulated , he is weak , he gets scared , he has hope. This is typical for Japanese World War two movies and for Japanese society. Since World War two is not a discussed theme in Japanese society, Japanese are likely to put Japanese in the second World War in the role of the victim. This victimisation is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another one the piled up bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is, when the Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the Japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike. In my personal conclusion I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual. It also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in. Once you have watched the movie fully, you will be able to see the horrors of the second World War to its total extent.\",\n",

She always wanted to perform before a \"captive audience\"? She must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another \"Wrath of Khan,\" or at least a \"Voyage Home.\" Captive\" is right. I wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out: \"mother, make it stop.\"  No question about it, \"Final Frontier\" is not just an unmitigated disaster, it\\'s cruel and unusual punishment. This is Star Trek from hell. This is Shatner on mushrooms -- or maybe peyote. This is Where No Man Has Gone Before and Wished He Never Had in the First Place.

       " b'FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. It starred Edward G. Robinson and was a very gritty story about a sleazy newspaper and their willingness to do anything...ANYTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, an old story of an innocent woman is plastered across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life--many years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal. The reason I loved the film so much was that it was unflinching and pulled no punches--showing just how low the publishers can be to sell papers.  Here in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, it is a remake of FIVE STAR FINAL--with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, this film stars Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same--except that it\\'s a bit less edgy and lacks some of the grit and sensationalism of the original. This isn\\'t to say the film is bad--it just doesn\\'t pack quite as good a punch as the first film. In other words, if you must see one of these films, see the first--though this film is quite powerful and enjoyable as well. As for me, I loved the story so much, I saw both films and enjoyed them both.  TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with the UBC radio owner complaining to his programming head (Bogart) that all the \"high brow\" shows he\\'s put on are getting low ratings. The owner demands muck--lots of muck in order to get more listeners. One way they discuss is to do a multi-part dramatization of a famous killing that occurred two decades ago--even though the killer was acquitted and she killed only in self-defense. However, they decide to play up the story as if she was guilty and they even go so far as to both send a writer to the lady\\'s home pretending to be a minister(!) as well as broadcasting her current name and whereabouts. Needless to say, this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy. Then, and only then, does Bogart feel any real remorse for producing such garbage--leading to a dandy finale about journalistic integrity and decency.  Well-acted, a great story idea and a message that is just as important today as it was back in the 1930s, this is one story you have to see. In particular, notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart---it is one heck of a great example of acting and writing.',\n",
       " b\"Is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age-wise?   Jemma Redgrave, although a superior actress, seems as if she should be joining her children instead of nodding off on the couch. (I would have loved to see Brenda Blethlyn in the part, her connection to the latest Pride and Prejudice notwithstanding.)  Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were the only two whom I felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance. Every else looked confused or out of place.   Luckily, I'm not very familiar with Dr. Who (I've only seen a few episodes so far) or it would have definitely soured this further.   Too bad Mansfield Park has not yet seen its due on screen (either large or small). This novel requires the talent of a Robert Altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully.\",\n",

It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.  It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century. The other bright-young things had make-up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party - the bleached-blonde Fanny, Billie Piper being the least credible character.  UK commercial television obviously believes heaving bosoms, pouting lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story. Fortunately Jane Austen had other ideas.  If you want to find out the story of Mansfield Park, buy the 1983 mini-series DVD.',\n",

The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself \"Sports Movie\". It\\'s the same thing, though. There are a few different writers for these films, the Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did some others, and I\\'m sure there\\'s another pair. I can\\'t even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest, it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them. I can\\'t tell if the Comebacks was done by the people who did Scary Movie or the guys who did Epic Movie, or someone else, it\\'s just the same jokes from all the others.  If you have ANY shred of taste or value for humour, don\\'t see this movie. If you have self-worth, don\\'t bother seeing it. If you have ANY respect for film making, don\\'t even consider watching it. Don\\'t see it in any broke down, derelict theatre that may still carry it, don\\'t rent it, don\\'t order it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, don\\'t Redbox it, and don\\'t even watch it for free on OD. Avoid it like the plague.  The only conceivable reasons I can see to watch this film are as follows.  A. Masochism. If you like torturing yourself, there\\'s very few better ways. B. Seeing a prime example of why to avoid ANYTHING that says \"Fox Atomic\". C. You\\'re being paid considerably high amounts of cash.  I really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me $100 to do it. It\\'s just mindless, mental collapsing torment.  You might as well watch Zohan.',\n",
       " b'I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It\\'s a very well shot first film (though the DV format begins to show itself in outside scenes), and I\\'m sure it has good intentions of showing us the \"dark side\" of high school - in other words every side of high school. But the filmmaker doesn\\'t have the talent to write or direct up to the premise\\'s promise. There are several characters, but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be. There\\'s no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of \"I am troubled teen X, I have Y problem.\" The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome.  Let\\'s start with the men. You have the stoner kid who\\'s gay, the jock who\\'s also gay, the boy who rapes his sister, and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. Naturally (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes), the two gay male characters beat up women, Peepants, and themselves. I\\'d be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. Yet neither took place, and that\\'s all there is to these characters\\' stories.  Next, the ladies. One young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the sister-raping brother, and there\\'s the girl who kills herself (I\\'ll get to that later). Again, I don\\'t think there\\'s a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers (I\\'d be out of a job were that the case), but I do think that it\\'s only justified if there\\'s more to that character or story. If that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than \"I\\'m a teenager and life sucks,\" I\\'d be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, or changed, or sublimated.  Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and HIGHLY sloppy storytelling. We\\'re supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we\\'ve seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? We\\'ve followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we\\'re invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn\\'t part of the story? It\\'s cheap, exploitative, and sloppy. Despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this, you have to EARN something like that. You can\\'t simply purchase it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down, and the film ends. What have I learned? I already knew high school sucked - been there, done that. I already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.  What else is there, then? Smoke, mirrors, and some really nice views of leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I\\'ve seen in a while.',\n",
       " b'How important is the director, anyway? In this film, made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts, asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director, William Greaves. It is an important work, as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking, organizing, and setting the scene; it reveals the role of the crew, something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief; and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match/don\\'t match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality (if at all).  The documentary, or pseudo-documentary, or fictional narrative (whichever you prefer, via your interpretations of the themes) has its brain in the over-educated, over-intellectual crew, its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions, and its heart in the director, who stands in as the desire to portray, to represent, to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it. It\\'s a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities. It\\'s a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously, just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective.  It\\'s an important work, and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film-making should watch and understand. It, like many experimental films, has no real mass-audience appeal--it\\'s not for them. It\\'s for the industry, and its for the 60s, asking what to do with a group-effort medium that still relies on a single \"voice\" and \"author\".  --PolarisDiB',\n",
       " b'Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. Beatle fans may argue that \"Hard Days Night\" was better and I am sure that many of the kids think \"8 Mile\" was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as \"Head\" and that is probably why it failed.  If Head had told a direct A to B type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. Could you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and I am being generous) of the acts are white. If you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the Monkess to sing \"Hey, Hey we are the Monkees. You know we like to please. A manufactured image, with no philosophy\". When you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dancing, and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.  The story, what there is, concerns the boys trying to flee their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away they end up inside a box. I don\\'t think you need to be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. Some neat little comedy bits follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and Peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. Even if you are put off by the story, you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.  Any film that begins and ends with Mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.',\n",
       " b\"NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't allow my children to see this. I definitely would tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof as to why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network The producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot wasn't even born when this event took place. Did anyone attached to this project try reading the Bible? There were more than two animals of each type taken. Read the story in Genesis. How could anyone bring this to any screen, small or large!\",\n",
       " b\"La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale. The setting is a city in thrall to mindless television, its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as The Voice. In a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends. It is up to a young family and The Voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing.  This is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve; the overt references to silent movie greats such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars, drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge.  La Antena mines the clich\\xc3\\xa9d plot devices and theatrical over-acting common to so many silent films, albeit in a very knowing and humorous way. It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station, this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a Studio Ghibli animation \\xc2\\x96 and all this using real actors and handmade sets.  Moreover, though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical, this is still an unsettling, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the TV Empire and the waning power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original ones, including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish TV food factory.  I hate to end this review on a sour note, but I feel that the English-language release of La Antena is let down by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect, with much playing around with words on screen. However, the English-language subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves. La Antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale.\",\n",
       " b\"What garbage, is there actually no part II? If this movie actually ends the way it did, everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed. This movie is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually a fairly decent movie. This movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars. I started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but I never imagined it would be this bad. This movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the American people for profit! If you have not seen this movie, don't bother. Movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. I really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks. Stay away! Don't be fooled by the hype!\",\n",
       " b\"Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a real poor script, uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well.   There are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them. What the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character. Instead now the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of an hero, it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain. I wish it only had a bit less Ghoulies though, fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie.  Ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures, who murder for pleasure. In this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. Besides, someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let the Ghoulies be able to talk this time. This works out really poorly and annoying. The Ghoulie-puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more, however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous Ghoulies movies.  It's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time. The movie is like a lame '80's high-school comedy (even though this movie got released in 1991). It's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie. It's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all.  The story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess, that never seems to end. The Ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie, involving the human characters. The movie is not at all about the Ghoulies terrorizing a college, with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage. No big surprise that this is Brent Olson's only written movie as of yet. He simply has no talent for it and I think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead.  Even when compared to the previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is just simply terrible!  2/10\",\n",

Although some of the sequences of scares and it\\'s unconventionally interesting plot work, some aspects just don\\'t. The bad dialogue and unlikeable characters gives a good reason to not care for them. But, often the suspense works and asks you the question of \"What would you do?\" and usually what you WOULD do isn\\'t what these idiots on the shuttle do.

It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people in it. Oh, and it's not funny. It's awful. So awful. Chris Stokes may be a superstar on BET, but he's an idiot. He can't write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a blacker, lesser-known Uwe Boll. Except Uwe Boll's films are funny awful, if you know what I mean. You can invite some buddies over, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies. Chris Stokes is like that, except if you invite friends over to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will be laughing. Not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock. I'm serious, I didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie. The acting is terrible, and the movie looks like a bad indie film. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean, what the hell? This movie just sucks; don't waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.\",\n",
       " b\"You should never ever even consider to watch this movie! It is absolutely awful! This isn't an overstatement!! It is so unbelievable and exaggerated, it gets boring.

If you'd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you, but still, you should plug your ears and just watch. It's not worth listening:p There are so many great movies out there, and if I could choose one, this would be the last movie I would pick. But all in all, it's your choice!!!   Enjoy!\",\n",
       " b\"It had its moments, but overall when I watched this cartoon as a child I was bored out of my mind. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. It is also one of my least favorite anime's, I remember others one involving a giant ship in space that made no sense, but was more enjoyable because they were in space. I also remember one with these people dressed like birds that was a bit strange, but more entertaining. I do not really like car racing though at all, did not then and still do not so that is probably one of the reasons I did not care for this show even though today I am an avid anime fan. The characters were a bit goofy too, and then there was the horrible scenes where virtually no action was taking place that was probably used to cut down on animation costs and to pad the show. The gadgets in the cars were cool though and provided some entertainment for me back then. Overall, I find this show to be rather unwatchable compared to newer animes and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion I am sure many other reviewers love the show which is cool.\",\n",
       " b\"One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting. The difference in activities (natural=feeding baby, watering garden; artificial=chess) is possibly significant.  The main contrast in this film is between this immoveable background and the placid, serene game of chess, and the fierce passions this latter causes, as accusations of cheating lead to a most undignified melee. The intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap, just as the pretensions of arty filmmakers are forever deflated by the 'cruder' demands of audiences.  What is most amusing about the film is not neccessarily this descent into slapstick, but the way it is filmed, its prolonging long after the initial joke has been made; the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with anything like attention, focusing instead on the set, while we catch glimpses of hurling feet and dislodged clothing. The film's refusal to edit is audacious, so that the humour seems to arise from something else other than the fight, reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation, our unwillngness to let go.  What is especially brilliant is the denouement, as these upper-class fops are caught by the valet, who picks them up like two errant schoolboys, as if he is about to box their ears. If masters can't be expected to keep their place with decorum, than somebody's going to have to do it for them.\",\n",
       " b\"When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent. I can't believe people are giving it the high ratings I've read here. Basically a forgettable, poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past. Two stars is all I can come up with. Sorry, guys.\",\n",

As goofy as this movie is, it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies, or just happens to have a sense of humor.  I know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of Better Off Dead... so what if it is? They were both excellent movies!

The songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie.  There was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time Gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star, not just a poor substitute to her sister. And the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through. It was an important part of the movie and they butchered it. It is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie. I was completely disappointed and had it not been for Bette Midler I would have shut the movie off.\",\n",
       " b\"Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.  I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.  Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. Eventually, I grew as bored with his remarks as I did the rest of this movie.  I am a big fan of South Park, and other animation aimed at adults. I also play several online pimp games, so I am partial to stories about pimps. The transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; but after that, both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable.  I give this movie a five. It is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. Just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.\",\n",

The producers said that the British humour from \"The Office\" and the Australian humour from \"Kath & Kim\" would not translate to an American audience......... WHAT??? So basically they are saying that Americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes, so they need to remake the shows with over-the-top childish gags, so that the Americans can understand the humour.

Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes. This is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, aficionados of terrible film-making will want to see this, but it\\'s very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad-movie viewer you are. The fact that Ron Hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding. If you are a movie director, and you actually think it\\'s OK for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words SLUG before the title appears, left over from your rough edit - and you apparently can\\'t muster the energy to edit those frames out - then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. I am astounded that Lions Gate/Maple agreed to release this movie on DVD. In spite of Rudy Ray Moore\\'s very brief cameo, this movie is a work of supreme self-indulgence on Ron Hall\\'s part - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it\\'s hard to believe he\\'d actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like I\\'m doing right now.

Young people today don\\'t realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one\\'s life a film seen in early youth can have in later life. This film, \"the blue lagoon\" had that effect on me.

It made me feel terrified at one second for Jimmy, and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next... and all the time I had my fingers crossed that things would work out for Jimbo!  Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb, Bryan Brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up, along with David Field, who was funny as well as being an evil git.  Since I saw this film I managed to order it on DVD and as a result, every person I show it to has been hooked in much the same way.  This film is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around.\",\n",
       " b'If you\\'ve ever listened to any of the James Lee Burke books on tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton you may agree with me that Will is the personification of Dave R.  Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I\\'ve heard) and no one portrays a Texan better IMHO, but he\\'s not a Cajun. His delivery is all wrong. I lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange patois that a Louisiana accent contains. TLJ doesn\\'t have anything like that.  I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be cast in this role? The Rock? Mickey Rourke? whoever, he\\'ll have to be big).  Overall, I thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didn\\'t have the normal interesting, yet non-linear continuity that the book typically has.  Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, \"Last Car to Elysican Fields\" would be a good choice. We\\'d get to see some of the best villains from JLB ever.',\n",
       " b'This movie has been done before. It is basically a unoriginal combo of \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and \"Sordid Lives.\" There are some funny bits, but otherwise it is a clich\\xc3\\xa9 bore. It is a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other films. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst. The main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas so no saccharine, coming out drama here!',\n",
       " b\"First, I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after viewing this movie I would highly disagree. There are some okay special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line might have been acceptable. I just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie, this is absolutely absurd (although she does look good). Add in a bunch of bad British acting and it's pretty much OVER. Most of the movie ends up taking place in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real Si-Fi Horror action and suspense.  \",\n",
       " b'Wow, what a strange film. It\\'s a David Lynch movie so it\\'s no surprise that it is weird.   I defy anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can\\'t be done. After some research following my second viewing of this film, I pretty much know most of the story but on a first look, and with no aid from other reviewers or outside help, it is hard to figure things out. So, if you\\'re in that boat and was confused, don\\'t feel bad; that\\'s normal. Let me just say the key to the film is Naomi Watts\\' character.  At any rate, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful visuals and rich colors and find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The camera-work is excellent and the music is creepy, a la Lynch\\'s \"Blue Velvet.\" There also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In all, it\\'s very well scored.  Like Lynch\\'s \"Twin Peaks\" television series, this was a film in which the end was pieced together afterward since Lynch thought this film was going to be a long, drawn-out TV series. When that didn\\'t happen, he pieced at the last minute this ending. That may account for some of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations concerning characters we see earlier in the film but who mysteriously disappear.  The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed.  Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their celebrated lesbian sex scene. Looks- wise, both women were chameleons, looking average at times, stunning at other times.  I enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first. It\\'s not just a curiosity piece; it\\'s a very intriguing movie.....just don\\'t feel stupid if you can\\'t make sense of a few things.',\n",
       " b'Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James \\'Jimmy\\' Trivette, Walker\\'s sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.  On this show, people don\\'t respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That\\'s not how life works, that\\'s not how people are. This show doesn\\'t take place in this reality.  The plot lines are about as realistic as Murder She Wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people\\'s houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. With Walker, everyone on the show, including the \"bad guys\", act like he\\'s the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. The lines that sometimes come out of people\\'s mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. It\\'s as if the scriptwriter for the part of Wesley Crusher (for the \"serious\" parts) and the scriptwriter for Bob Saget\\'s funniest home videos (for the \"humor\" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.  This show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. It\\'s for the elderly. It\\'s for wishful thinkers. It\\'s for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. It\\'s for people who want to drift away into oblivion. It\\'s for people whose drug of choice is their television.  I cringe every time I see even a commercial for this show. My opinion is that it is THE worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.  I used to like Chuck Norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. I can\\'t even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.',\n",
       " b\"Ernesto is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money. Together with Manco, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living, but that is not making him a rich man by any means. Enter Federico, an older man who is more experience in the art of deception. Together with the younger Ernesto they prove a winning combination. That only lasts until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appears in the picture.  This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem, is light in tone and pleasant to sit through. Other, better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one, but the film is easy to take, and at times, it has a lot of funny situations.  This viewer will see Federico Luppi in anything, even reading the telephone directory! He is an actor's actor. We have had the privilege of having seen him in the Buenos Aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career. As Federico, he does what he does best. It's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, the son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun as she gets involved with these con men. Miguel Alexandre, a veteran actor, is also good as Manco.\",\n",
       " b\"I caught this movie at the Glenwood Cinemas at the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema.   I have been keen on Australian Film for a number of years, so was pleased to learn that this film was included, and I was certainly not disappointed.   Superbly shot, firmly directed, it's an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness, as it were. It reminded me a tad of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that strange madness in it, but I was glued to the movie for other reasons - namely that it presents a portrait of Australia which is..well, very believable.  I have vacationed to the Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 1980's and again about 7 years ago with my wife.   I don't wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations, but the director Frayne appears to have a grasp on much that I find so odd and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the extremities of, say, Nick Cave on one hand, and Steve Irwin (the 'Crocodile Hunter') on the other.  One incy wincy whinge - - I would have preferred even more of the 'unknown' Australia. Much more in fact. But I also realise that there's only 1 and a half hours to do it all in... 'Sigh.'  Overall though, this movie is very, very accomplished.\",\n",
       " b\"The 1990s film with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly showered with praise, and I enjoyed it very much, but this TV original is just as good, and in some ways, more appropriately cast. Claire Bloom isn't a brash Joy, but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances).  Quieter, calmer, and less emotional than the Attenborough film this may be, but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue. You'll still cry to this version, but perhaps you won't have the musical prompts to set you off.  There's room for both - and having seen this on stage, I would say that the Ackland/Bloom one is slightly more faithful. But they're both excellent.\",\n",
       " b'This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep.  Utterly boring long silent(yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips.  Instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow- it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing Arabs being malicious to everyone around them.  Sulieman (the Director) should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film.  It deserves a one for the movie quality, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof.)',\n",
       " b\"I spotted this film in a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on holiday, and it seemed like a bit of silly fun. And sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids, and their parents too.  10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to his father's (Larry Miller) dismay. As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance ... and once again Ricky's mind 'takes off' and suspects some criminal plot is happening.  Reluctantly aided by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others they try to get to solve the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film's thrilling climax! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos play parts in a family film. And watching the DVD interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part.  I totally liked Junior Pilot; charming and good-natured performances, funny plot line and a real; sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness.  If you are looking for an entertaining family film, you could do far worse than buy this one.\",\n",
       " b\"This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film. Some good characters, but not many. Not worth wasting one's time.\",\n",
       " b\"Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.  SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. It goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who takes a liking to her, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. But who did it?  I love the acting, they have a lot of great talent in here. The suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. If it comes on TV watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10\",\n",
       " b'\"Death Promise\" is a lost 70\\'s exploitation gem and deserves to be seen. Technically somewhat of a mess and boasting a stock of amateur New Yawk types, this film never bores. I highly recommend tracking this down. It\\'s a hoot and a half.',\n",
       " b'Like many a child born in the 1980\\'s, I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that weren\\'t necessarily the \\'racier\\' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw those, of course, though not as frequently as now), but the ones meant for the \"whole family\", Spaceballs, and this film. I knew at the time I wasn\\'t seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and/or adventure movies. But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids, if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities, and b) once a kid sees it, when he revisits it, as I have a few times, it\\'s still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around. It\\'s a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course, as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times), but one that references Brooks\\'s own movies as well; this is a filmmaker who isn\\'t above poking fun at even his own style.  Basic story- Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with King Richard gone, and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to, naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), butts heads with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing, so much of it sticks that it\\'s hard not to chuckle. It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at his very best), Brooks\\'s own cameo as the Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle\\'s acting turns, and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of it is obvious, yes, some of it just takes right from the pages of Blazing Saddles, sure, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Definitely- and for parents who grew up on the 70\\'s Brooks work, it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this (even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated, all in good fun).',\n",
       " b\"Dubbed beyond comprehension, the HBO version of Lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film. Some scenes simply don't make sense in English and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading. Add in the self-censorship involving CIA operative Frank Carlucci, and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power. Here's hoping the subtitled version gets to American television screens at some point.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a relatively watchable movie (+1). After watching UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this one looks good, in comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffes, although the vampiric teeth look odd.  The story line makes no sense. Let's see. An American GI fights vampires. Comes back to the states and is rehabilitated for seeing... Vampires. His commanding officer is the aunt of his ex-wife. Who happens to be doing some research on the biodiversity of the South American area where the vampires are. Huh! Don't pile on too many coincidences. Who cares about the head vampire? Or, his daughter? Or, any one in this film? The only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can't come out in the day, etc.) are wrong. But, they can't be killed except by beheading or a wood wound in the heart. Yeah, right. It's obvious they just didn't want to film a dark movie, since this is a made for TV film.  It would have been nice for the viewer, if they had hired some actors. Oh, they've got Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman), and a big, black dude with a tremendously deep voice, who snarls appropriately in order to show off his vampire teeth prosthetics. But, otherwise, you would never know they had actually paid people to read these lines.  There is more than enough fight scenes, and some vampire-biting-neck blood, but no real violence.\",\n",
       " b'LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005).  A completely unique take on silent cinema in this fairy-tale like story by Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black-and-white and practically without dialog, \"La Antena\" is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of German expressionist cinema, with most of the nods to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau.  \\'The City without a Voice\\', \\'La Ciudad sin Voz\\', is ruled by Mr. TV. He has taken the inhabitants voices and is in total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat his own brand of TV-food. Mr TV is not just a monopolist, he is the personification of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears as a symbol a number of times. He secretly works on a hypnotizing device to control all the citizens minds through his television broadcasts. For this purpose, he kidnaps the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a TV repairman witnesses the kidnapping and flees to an old TV antenna in the mountains in order to halt Mr. TV\\'s evil plans.  The production design is stunning with beautiful sets and imagery. Although shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema, Esteban Sapir also adds a number of fresh techniques of his own, like a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks with each other through text balloons (usually floating near their mouths), the louder they talk, the larger the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book, titled \"La Antena\", that opens and a city of paper rises from the pages. There are hardly any references to Argentina. It\\'s constantly snowing, which gives the film a very un-Argeninian feel, while the surreal setting suggests any large city in the Northen hemisphere, with only some of the songs revealing the film\\'s Argentinian background.  The pace is swift and there is so much happening on screen, it\\'s hard to keep track of the film\\'s surreal narrative. Not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at, we\\'re also given a few messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are breezily packaged. One of the most original films I\\'ve seen in years. A delight.  The film was shown as the opening film at the IFF Rotterdam 2007.  Camera Obscura --- 9/10',\n",
       " b\"This movie is just great... It starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses.....well the fun keeps on coming. The power of the movie is perhaps in it's subtle references to a lot (and I mean a lot) of other movies. For me the best part was perhaps the Bruce Lee/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon scene. How the two actors switches from French to Chinese or whatever Asian language it was, it was awesome. Then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious but perhaps you won't understand all of them when your an American (no offense). Overall a great movie\",\n",
       " b'i paid $2.00 for this piece of crap, i want my money back. it is a d grade horror movie that isn\\'t so groovy  There are many MANY floors in this film, including the acting, the lack of actual horror, the lack of nudity (which besides the starting Nurse (porno outfit) and the still breathing nude corpse flash, there is none.  The sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs/tracks.  There are your usual typical characters, the jock, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie cop/ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar coins into that gap..or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the Pure girl.  The make up was pitiful with side views of dr chopper showing a clear \"make up line\"and natural skin tones, the cover art to the DVD is clearly photoshop/enhanced to make the cover more enticing as Dr chopper looks like an old \"plopper\" The scraggy women that hang around Dr chopper are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie.  The plot twist was VERY predictable and the abundance of bad looking FAKE limbs was laughable, what did they think,.... um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film.  Dr chopper himself is the most stupid character created I\\'ve seen in a while, though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme Doctor and chopper (bike) and thought \"bingo\" ill make a crappy movie about that.  I\\'ve seen worse before..... but this is just plain bad.. everything about it is bad... the lack of suspense...the lack of actual horror or character development... the lack of a decent storyline ...the only thing good about this film was when it finished.

       " b\"THEIR PURPLE MOMENT   Aspect ratio: 1.33:1  Sound format: Silent  (Black and white - Short film)  Two luckless nightclub revellers (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bill, provoking violent retribution from a hot-tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford).  Typical L&H scenario, less substantial than some of their best work from this period, but worth a look nonetheless. Stan takes center-stage this time round, caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his aggrieved wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons. Some of the prolonged closeups of Laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. 1920's morality is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, playing a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great joy in alerting L&H's respective spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to their husbands' bad behavior. The ending fizzles, but the movie still has much to recommend it. Directed by James Parrott.\",\n",
       " b'This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad\\'s ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned. The inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish Moran and she for him. In the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no man -\"and no woman.\" (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive either. Valentino does well in a romantic, action role. His sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. He is very appealing. This is no great film but it passes the time. What it really showcases is Valentino\\'s beauty and sexiness.',\n",
       " b'Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.  This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!   This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie, but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun, silly, sexy, and goofy good time!',\n",
       " b\"I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the town where Zombie Planet was filmed. I'd heard about the film forever ago, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. Then, for several years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found it sitting all by itself at the local video store, just itching for a rental. So, being the cinephile that I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a shot.  Bad idea.  Zombie Planet is overlong, boring, poorly acted, miserably shot -- and that's just the good stuff. I tried my hardest to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline. Alas, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad it's pathetic. And the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms I'm sure they've heard. Move on, you guys. Please. In fact, refrain from film-making altogether. Or attend a few classes on pacing, storytelling, and, well, basic direction.  Otherwise, for the love of God, hang it up.\",\n",
       " b'This movie could have been oh so much better. It is a beautiful story set in very trying times, and yet it was so poorly executed. The leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs, and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film. Although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced. The directing could have been more concise. The bulk of the criticism should go to the writers, who took a good story and made it tedious. In short, there are thousands of MUCH better ways to spend 2 hours.',\n",

       " b'the subspecies series is an always will be the best vampire movies ever. there is something about them that makes them special i think it`s the feeling you get when you watch them .  they are set in modern times and yet they feel as if they are set in the 1700`s or 1800`s i think it has some thing to do with the set`s that are used if so then it`s working keep it up guy`s :).  in a quick round up of what`s happened in the first part - Radu was supposedly bannished from his home land years ago by his father and he has decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birth rite. the blood stone and all his father has so he kill`s his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man from the Phantasm movies). and takes the blood stone which has emense power to who ever has it because who has it need never kil anyone again because the stone is supposedly meant to drip the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop from it he is slowly going insane. (thats all we need an insane vampire as if a normal vampire aint bad enough). well Radu`s brother Stephan try`s to put a stop to his evil ways all while trying to stop himself falling inlve with a tourist who is staying at a house/fort which belongs to a friend of his.  well one thing leads to another and the two brothers clash and well you will have to see the movie to see what goes on from here on in.  i will review/comment on the other sequels soon .  the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and this is not so this will not appeal to everyone but this has an atmosphere far superior to that of buffy although Radu does not look as good as the wonder full Sarah Michelle Gellar :).  rating for this movie 10/10 a fine example of how a vampire movie should be done :).

       " b'This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you cram into just one movie? Notes are misplaced, bags are switched, conversations are misheard, people get mixed up, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something. The writers are really struggling to keep everything going, which makes the dialogues feel really forced. If anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives, but they have to keep the misunderstandings going. At times this movie also tries to go for some juvenile laughs, but all those do is remember you about how funny \"American Pie\" was. The scene with the nerd telling the hooker (who he thinks is a foreign exchange student) to \"eat his sausage\" goes on forever, not one second of it is funny. I\\'ve got to give this movie some credit though: because of the subplot about stolen money, it\\'s not as boring as it could have been. It also has a laugh here and there, but then sadly goes back to yet another character misunderstanding stuff. Overall this movie is just way too lame.',\n",
       " b'Being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, I always knew I would like this film. However, I wasn\\'t prepared for just how good the documentary actually is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop which has been there from the very start. The \"story\" begins in the early 70\\'s, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant).  The editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. Aside from the excellent visual \"scratch\" techniques which they used, the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent, giving the film pace when it is needed. The sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions.  The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We aren\\'t taken by the hand through the story, and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another side to the story, and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being shunned left, right and centre by the music business.  Although there are many excellent things about this film, I do have a few gripes. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca$hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, and also DJs from outside America, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you watch the commentary on the DVD (something which I highly recommend), producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca$hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts.  This is definitely the best documentary I\\'ve seen on hip-hop culture and music. It does stop short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for that I highly recommend checking out the DMC and ITF videos. However, that is a minor quibble. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)',\n",
       " b'What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedly  First off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15  Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?  But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here  There are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life  But I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing',\n",

       " b'This is possibly the worst of the worst. I am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and I can believe this movie was allowed to be made. The acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic. The camera work was also juvenile. One scene that comes to mind is outside a store. It is nighttime and you can see the moon, yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall. There was no street light to be seen. One character gets gutted at one point, yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post. Come on!!! It felt like I was watching a middle school play. I kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth \"hi mom\". I can only give it two positive comments...it ended and it was good for a laugh. Please do not rent this movie!!!!',\n",
       " b'\"Disappointing\" is the best word I could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.  One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the US athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced.  What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?), appear to glorify US sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes (with a few celebrated exceptions). For example, the viewer is led to believe that the US won the majority of medals in the Games, when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of 6 total. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen (thus we have an arrogant Brit, and a wine-swilling French). This attitude does very little service to the Olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate.  In conclusion, I believe that this film would appeal to that part of the US audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere.',\n",
       " b\"Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.  The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century England built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick.  Unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B western and not even a good one at that.  Gabby Hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the garrulous Gabby.  If you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless Gabby Hayes then see this film.\",\n",

       " b\"One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments. Overall, though, it is a fine piece of work.\",\n",
       " b'As an indie filmmaker, I try to at least make a decent film . This piece of ____ was beyond low budget. It was shot on video and not 24P mini-DV at least. The look and feel of this was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in LA and he was talking about that book, Film-making for dummies that he was putting together. I thought this little video was going to be something but I guess I was wrong. He could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video. The plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards. I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. Damn!!!!! I did buy JoyRide which was a hell of a movie. Maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film-making and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick. Maybe he should learn from the masters who made, Night of the living dead and The Evil Dead and Chain saw massacre. just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits. This is one video that should have stayed dead. I cannot call it a film because he did not use film.',\n",

I was about to use the clich\\xc3\\xa9\\' about Hollywood not making pictures like this anymore, but then I just saw, \"Up in the Air,\" another intelligent film about 2 people over the age of 35 who fall in love. That\\'s where the similarities end, though. \"House Calls\" is just sheer fun watching 2 pros like Matthau and Jackson hit it off and seem completely natural while they\\'re at it. I saw this film in the theater in 1978 (at the ripe old age of 18) and it took me another 20 years to get all of the jokes. Any film that can make punch lines out of 1920\\'s tennis great Bill Tilden, and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain wouldn\\'t play too well at the megaplex these days. One other thought: the original theatrical release featured a \\'walk on the beach / fall in love\\' montage set to The Beatles/George Harrison tune, \"Something.\" It seemed a bit forced at the time, but that song has since been swapped out for a rather generic Henry Mancini music cue for subsequent home video and cable release.

       " b'In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don\\'t press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.  One\\'s enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story \"Button Button\" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly\\'s previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.  If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family, become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.  What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending, which won\\'t be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz\\'s Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly\\'s pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.  Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film\\'s rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved.',\n",
       " b'Anyone remember the docudrama THREADS ? It\\'s a drama documentary which shocked Britain in September 1984 . Whilst not exactly wholly entertained by Mick Jackson\\'s nuclear holocaust horror film I could respect it . Unfortunately I can\\'t respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a radioactive dirty bomb in the centre of London   The problem I have with it is that director Daniel Percival production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values . The cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need superb and well lit Oscar standard cinematography ? What we certainly don\\'t need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly stagger out of the smoke . Neither do we need vaguely well known cast members . Did anyone else sit there asking themselves \" Hey what was he in ? I know that face \" several times ? I know I did and it\\'s very distracting .   Perhaps the biggest production flaw with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama . In THREADS the action cuts away from the action in Sheffield umpteen times and becomes an edition of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and THREADS is very effective because of this . Here the information presented suffocates the drama which drowns in expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue . The characters in the teleplay aren\\'t really characters they\\'re just cyphers there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded . It would have been better for the action to cut to captions to convey this type of information ala THREADS . The worse thing is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique as seen in THREADS a couple of years ago with his docudrama about smallpox . He should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR  I should also lay my cards on the table and state that while I don\\'t consider most Muslims are terrorists I am getting slightly fed up of TV productions like THE HAMBURG CELL , THE GRID and DIRTY WAR having to point out this fact to me by whalloping me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of patronising PC attitudes in TV companies nowadays  I managed to miss the studio debate that Bob mentions here but I have also heard it discussed elsewhere and I can\\'t help thinking it makes better viewing than DIRTY WAR itself with its heated arguments between differing factions of the political spectrum . If DIRTY WAR is remembered twenty years from now ( Highly unlikely I know ) it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything',\n",
       " b'Bears about as much resemblance to Dean Koontz\\'s novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. If you\\'ve read the book, I suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie.  Watchers is your typical \"Boy meets dog, dog turns out to be super-intelligent government lab experiment, dog and boy are pursued by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab, and, oh yeah, did I mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog?\" movie.  Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (named Furface here; Einstein in the book).  The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is laughable, the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is Haim\\'s character\\'s unquestioning acceptance of the dog\\'s intelligence, as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it\\'s gotta be the puppy chow, right? Haim\\'s performance is enthusiastic but shaky, as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill. Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie, and this is no exception. He easily gives the best performance of the movie, although I\\'m compelled to add that the dog (who\\'s a pretty darn good actor himself!) comes in a close second.  All in all, an atrociously dumb movie, and yet . . . And yet I watched it three times within a week. And yet I can\\'t help liking it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I\\'ve ever actually tasted Michael Ironside- I\\'m sure there are laws against that). But any movie that can make me laugh that hard (yes, even unintentionally) can\\'t be all bad. Chalk it up to a guilty pleasure, a \"yes I know it\\'s insultingly stupid but I like it anyway\" movie.  It\\'s tough for me to rate this. On a normal scale I\\'m forced to give it a D-, but on my own personal cheese scale, it gets bumped up to an A-.  Yeah, I know. I\\'m weird like that.',\n",

I was half way into this 77 minute film when I realized I had no idea who anyone on screen was. It was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character. Certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center, there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough. Its not.

       " b'So much great chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum the script cut away and dealt with some irrelevant sub-plot that did nothing to advance the story. Indeed, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. They were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie.   The writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously didn\\'t trust themselves to write compellingly about relationships and the interior lives of their characters. They seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights. Or perhaps they didn\\'t trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring \"Casablanca\" was.   Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and Dutch had been developed more and had been allowed to play out, the writers would have know how to end the story. This film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.',\n",

People in the US have known for a long time that Showtime is the new HBO, they are making far better cutting edge, powerful shows and this is no exception. The show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted, taking in important facets such as faith, religion, funding, means and needs. To the uninitiated, there is much to be learnt about the Muslim faith here. Unlike on mainstream shows like \"24\" where the terrorists are merely nutcases who the good guys shoot, their purpose and reasonings here are fully examined. What gives the show more credence is the latest technology the cell/FBI uses and the authentic shots in europe, the US and the middle east, no expense is spared to tell the story accurately The cast are relatively unknowns but the acting is superb with the aid of a tautly-written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns.

Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears. With her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that Nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. There is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that.\",\n",
       " b\"Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper, and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have given the movie more stature. This is a good movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock movies, we see the director's disregard for the socially suave and the well-heeled. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upper-class folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent. These upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to elevate the regular guy, the bungler and the fellow who doesn't take himself too seriously. One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy-next-door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, as the spunky female lead, comes off as the all-American girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test. Robert Cummings, as defence plant worker Barry Kane, is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-established formulas from previous films - the reluctant female who is drawn into the action, e.g. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels. We view scenes of America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of. We see rivers, bridges, backwoods cabins, truckers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut to the ship Normandy) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it.\",\n",

Once the viewer understands the premise; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn-able and rise to the status of demigods, then the rest is sheer joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse, and so differently affected by the events of the film.

Nonetheless it works very well, credit must be given to the costume designer\\'s and director\\'s of the film. The look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in. The costumes look like the Renaissance appearance one might envision to be.  The film portrays a very anti-Semitic vibe. From the first minute to the last it is shown how the Catholic\\'s try to take advantage of the Jews in every way they can, even to the point of keeping them locked away in \"ghettos\" and not allowing them to regular jobs. In comparison to The Passion of the Christ, another recent film that people believed to be very Anti-Semitic, Merchant of Venice makes Passion look like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the Jews received. The location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, making it just that much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics.  Although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act. The oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated. That in itself might not be funny, but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing. The whole cross dressing scene, as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director Michael Radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized. The director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men, which in part takes away from the scene but doesn\\'t kill it entirely.  Overall the film gets a 7 out of 10',\n",
       " b\"It pains me to say this about an Australian film but Mr. Accident ranks with the worst of the worst films I have ever seen. What's even more tragic is that it doesn't fit into the 'it's so bad it's good' category. What annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless, unfunny, underdeveloped, inept screenplay. Dumb performances (What are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this trash?), inadequate direction, no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favour and stay away!\",\n",
       " b\"The thesis of Father Brown is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all of life's problems. A little proselytizing I don't mind, but this gets a bit ridiculous at times.  Some fine actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him, but you didn't see any great demand for future Father Brown films.  I suppose if you are a committed Roman Catholic it all makes perfectly good sense. It's far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he's brought to justice.   But that's what were asked to accept here. In fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners Sidney James had heisted during a robbery.  That's the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that James has confided in him so he can't break the confessional.   Now on to bigger game. Master thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to Father Brown and was said to belong to St. Augustine back in the day. But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice. So he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission.  I'm sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow. Father Brown I'd hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested. And he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advice.  Author G.K. Chesterton, a very noted Catholic lay person in his day, finds all this very reasonable. Carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests.  Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and from Barry Fitzgerald in Going My Way to create Father Brown. Granted though Brown is a lot shrewder than the other two. There's also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this portrayal. In The Bridge on the River Kwai, Guinness also was playing a character who's rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation Nicholson was in.   Father Brown's an entertaining fellow when he's solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish. We've enjoyed Brother Cadfael do it in a medieval setting and American audiences liked Father Dowling played by Tom Bosley a few years back.   This film should have stuck to being entertaining.\",\n",
       " b'My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. \"They\\'re laserdiscs of Flash Gordon serials,\" he says. \"I\\'m gonna have some giant coasters,\" I say. But not so. This serial rocks. (But I had to whine & moan to almost everyone I knew to find a laserdisc player for em).  There is really a little of everything in this serial: There are lion-men, hawk-men, shark-men, Earthmen, & I guess you\\'d call em Mongo-men. The sets & costumes combine, Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and there\\'s even armour like English knights. Awesome costumes. And some of it was a riot. Those horrible tights with shorts over em worn by Zarkov are beyond description. And the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers.  It\\'s also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an octosack, the orangutan to orangapoid, and the tiger to a tigron. There\\'s even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature who threatens Flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off).  You like the Invisible Man? This has got you covered. You like sword fights, wrestling (both animals & men), fist fights? Plenty for any taste. We have an underwater city, a sky city, a city on top of a mountain, and tonnes of secret passages and caves.  Hokey effects? Massive amounts. The sky city is supported by radium furnaces stoked like old-time steamships. The rocketships are \"powered\" by fireworks and have constant backfires and/or humming noises. Lots of wires are visible holding things up (like food when Flash was invisible and of course rocketships). There\\'s clouds out in space, but none around the earth when viewed from Mongo. \"Giant\" lizards show up briefly. Fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten Flash & co. on the way to the shark-men\\'s underwater city. The \"gadgets\" in Dr. Zarkov\\'s lab crack me up. And they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he\\'s in (he worked in Ming\\'s lab and Vultan\\'s).  And yeah, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) just not the person she would have preferred. In fact, it seems a lot of the sub-plots concern intrigue on the part of Princess Aura to try to win Flash.  Man I think the characters are awesome. That fat, horse-laughing, King Vultan was hilarious. How he managed those wings was pure artistry. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have had him for the emperor in Starwars. Ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial. Princess Aura was quite a little character too. And she pulled it off nicely. I think she\\'s a better actress than Dale Arden by a long shot. Even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character---and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding Dale. Now we get to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero---and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly.  After watching this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. Watch this, you\\'ll see what I mean.  If you ever considered watching an old serial (or any serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. The only reason I didn\\'t give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily, the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there, and a couple of weak characters (king of shark-men & king of lion-men).',\n",
       " b\"So many people loved this movie, yet there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who found Mirrormask excruciatingly uncomfortable to watch and arse-clenchingly boring. I fall into the latter of these two camps, and I will try to explain what it was that made my toenails curl so unpleasantly.  Firstly, to set the record straight - I like Neil Gaiman's books. I sometimes find his knowing, sarcastic, 'wry asides' humour a little geeky, and I actually prefer his work when he is playing it straight and leaving the jokes alone - but, even with his occasional lapses into crap 'dad' gags, I find his creativity and imagination to be something a bit special.  Interestingly, one of Gaiman's strongest works is Coraline, a Gothic fairy story for kids that is very low on jokes and high on tension and creepiness. His latest novel (Anansi Boys) overdoes the funnies, and tends to read at times like Terry Pratchett does the Sisters of Mercy (not the nuns but the band). Mirrormask inhabits similar territory to Coraline, and when I saw the stunning visuals in the trailer, I got a bit excited that somebody had managed to transfer Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination to the screen.  In praise of the film, some sequences do look stunning. However, the visual effects are occasionally ruined by CGI animation that looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character animation looks clumsy, amateur and cheap. In an early dream sequence, the spider is animated beautifully, but the book-eating cat-beast looks poorly rendered and very 'computer generated'. Compared with the standard of animation found in productions such as 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask occasionally looks very amateur indeed. However, in Mirrormask's defence, the budget was tiny for such a grand vision, and a few creaks in the effects can be understood and forgiven.  What cannot be forgiven is the stilted, stagy, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors struggle desperately with the dialogue - and there is so much of it that they are constantly hampered and stumbling over it. Conversation is rendered completely unnatural, the jokes fall flat time and time again, and the turgid speeches appear to be the writer's only method of plot exposition. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against a blue screen (which always adds an element of 'Phantom Menace') - this renders the film almost unwatchable. In such an unreal setting the actors need to work twice as hard to be believed, and in the main they fail terribly. The girl who plays the lead role puts in a valiant struggle against the impossible stage-school dialogue, and occasionally shows real promise, but it is never enough. The god-awful cod-'Oirish' of the Valentine character (with whom she is forced to spend an inordinate amount of screen time) puts paid to any chance of this young actress rising above the material. It appears to be Valentine's job to explain the plot to younger viewers, and to add a bit of light relief. Personally, I wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15 year old daughter.  What else is wrong with this film? Answer....Rob Brydon. What's annoying (for us Brits, anyway) is we know Rob Brydon can act! We've seen him hold the screen for half-an-hour on his own (doing those 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and in the first 'real world' bit of the film he is fine. However, stick him in front of a blue screen and he loses all sense of character and turns into the worst am-dram-ham I've seen in years. A real shame.  What else is wrong? Answer... the wanky slap-bassing, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and unlistenable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never shuts up. God, the music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant and, if that isn't enough, has wanky slap bass wanking all over it. It makes the dialogue very hard to hear, but that could be a blessing in disguise.  What else is wrong with it? Answer.... The whistling mime artist. In modern society there should be no place for mime, apart from certain secret places in France. Every moment the camera lingers on the gurning, whistling, moss-juggling, yogurt-weaving idiot, I understand why the Edinburgh locals get a bit anxious and fractious when Festival time comes round again.  My final criticism is that the film is pretty dull. Surrealism often is dull \\xc2\\x96 it either requires its audience to slip into a dreamlike, Zen, accepting state, or for the audience be constantly wowed by bigger and grander surprises. A story with a bit of pace involving characters that we could believe in and care about would have gone a long way to giving this film the emotional centre that it sadly lacked, whilst stopping the eyelids from drooping.  Finally, apologies to all those who found depth, meaning and wonder in this film. You have managed to suspend your disbelief, you have seen past the creaky CGI, ignored the crappy dialogue and the abysmal performances that resulted, and understood the maker's grand, imaginative vision. I wanted to, but I couldn't see past the real-world failings that dragged it down.  I hope Neil Gaiman gets it right next time, if he gets (or even wants) the opportunity.\",\n",
       " b\"Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self, but, when her character talks about all the guys she serviced, and to see her with Michael Madsen and an Asian guy in the present tense of the movie, it made me feel like I needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, like a disease was going to rub off on me or something.  The movie felt like it was going for a love triangle/drama/action/??? plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The acting was great, the plot, not so great. The director needs to at least pick a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it obviously.\",\n",
       " b\"I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the moment they were delivered, planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and, due to this, the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience. This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree.  Granted, this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but, seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period, it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murders sequences are grim and tense, and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids. I don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable. The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights, such as 'Village of the Damned', 'The Bad Seed' and 'Children of the Damned'. This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this.   Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema, but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this isn't enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the star of TV-series 'Jake and the Fatman'. Check it out!!\",\n",
       " b'This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of \"we\\'re just a bunch of wacky guys\" in the midst of the \"my goodness this can be really dangerous\" parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn\\'t believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn\\'t bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn\\'t rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.  Thing is I\\'m a John Travolta fan. Every interview of his I\\'ve seen just raises my opinion of him. I think this was one strictly for the money. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be happy when this one gets forgotten.',\n",
       " b'When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked, the audiences were turned off by Hitch\\'s attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film), and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it\\'s star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn\\'t). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it\\'s favor.  With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning, and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy\\'s personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won\\'t divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy\\'s destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the \"eccentric\" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other\\'s foe!  It\\'s a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno, of course does kill Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he finds that he is the police department\\'s number one suspect. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions he has the latter\\'s lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police, and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?  Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully, so that from the start we see both our \"heroes\" from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other\\'s orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful, and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one, but his marriage\\'s failure, coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman, has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.  The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), who bears a close resemblance to Miriam, and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background, and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers, Leo G. Caroll as the Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno\\'s dotty mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.',\n",
       " b\"I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the set.  I am sure that George Zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second film in which I saw him, the first being DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. However, even good acting couldn't save THE MAD MONSTER.  Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another.  In this case, like so many others of its ilk, it is a transfusion of (I assume) wolf's blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop.   Beyond his experiments, Dr. Cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes!   The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. No doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but, in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this.\",\n",
       " b'I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.  This is a great short film for the following reasons:   1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.  2. Beautifully shot. The lighting, framing and general filming are striking. The 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts. And what a difference it makes. The filming is worthy of this film stock.  3. Strong story. Often short films try to do too little or too much with the time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance of telling you an interesting story, without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied. You wonder what will happen next, while at the same time, feeling you saw something happen.  Nice score, too. Compliments without overpowering.  If you can find this at a festival, make an effort to see it.',\n",
       " b'There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and a couple of them have been shown in some of the past comments. This is a movie to be analyzed as a free recreation of a known subject and therefore not to be compared with the opera, the book or other Carmen movies seen before. It just stands for itself and I must say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step to deny movies the chance to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the art direction, the costumes and the photography are extremely well put together to achieve a pleasing aesthetic experience. Let\\'s take it as it is.  And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clich\\xc3\\xa9s in the movie. Well, historically the movie is extremely well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. It is not only an accurate portrait of the \"black Spain\" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrayed so vividly, but it\\'s also of that part of history as seen by a foreigner fascinated with the folkloric side of that society. Honestly, anyone who doesn\\'t want to see any clich\\xc3\\xa9 about Spain shouldn\\'t buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clich\\xc3\\xa9s are presented before they became one and the way to see them is getting rid of our own prejudices.  Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance for not having understood his or her lines. If all the rest of the audience did, the problem most likely lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an immaculate diction with her Andalusian accent and all she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentinian partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, gives also a convincing portrait of the Basque officer that became a \"bandolero\", and her accent is very well learned.  No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is \"horrible\" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that used to recommend us pictures he found homosexually arousing, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not totally fair for the rest of us, especially for the ones that hadn\\'t detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn\\'t necessarily had to care for. I\\'m not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role, because that\\'s what we got. Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent one, in Vicente Aranda\\'s movie.',\n",
       " b\"A gem from Japan, where so many of the world's best films are being made today. Stylistically, this isn't anything all that special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for voicing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50 year old spinster. She's takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she is done with this part time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, which made this Army of Darkness fan giggle). Along her milk route lives a 50 year old man, whose wife is dying. It turns out the milk woman and the man, a child services worker, dated in high school, and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other. The film actually has some major narrative problems. When the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique. The climactic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters, as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down, but never end up doing so. I think the best thing in the film is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems were, the film mostly transcends them.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie. Shatner's acting is okay. The production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired. Overall, I think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair.\",\n",
       " b'This is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007.  The tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told.  Beautifully shot, and scripted - from childhood to the adulthood it never falters.  A brilliant insight into a lost culture, and a very good way to understand Farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right. It is both compassionate and thrilling, uplifting and filled with immense sorrow, joyful and depressing.  With excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best.  Highest recommendation: a real slice of life that uplifts and informs.',\n",
       " b\"This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Even being hangover didn't help. The plot is lousy, if existent. The relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help. I guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience. Do NOT see this flick\",\n",
       " b\"I think not! I mean yeah if you compare this film to The Godfather, or maybe a little older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good job to cute little Justin Henry.   While I was watching this film for like the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed, cause I haven't seen any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five Oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.  Thanks for your time.\",\n",
       " b\"I just watched Congo on DVD.In most cases I love these kind of movies but this one is different. It made me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result. You can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. And as a producer Frank Marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch; he never should have tried to become another Spielberg. This one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen. If Can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one. If you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind.\",\n",
       " b\"When I saw this movie, all I could think was: What a disaster! No I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I have seen a lot of movies, but this is certainly one of the worst ever. I don't care about the fact if a volcano erupting underneath downtown L.A. is possible or not. Perhaps it isn't, but even than this could have been a good movie... but it sure isn't and I'll explain you why.  I don't know how much lava flows out of an average volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano in this movie makes the Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo together look like a little barbecue. I don't think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as what we see in this film. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie, but I really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying that he should have hired a top cast, but this really is the opposite of what I would call good acting. Their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worse.  And what's wrong about the script you probably ask yourself. Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for the heath? Or people sinking in the earth when the flow of lava isn't even two foot high?   I'm sure I wouldn't be proud if I wrote such a script, but apparently there are script writers in Hollywood who don't mind about believability as long as it pays good money! VERY good money!!!  When you see the movie, you'll probably agree with me that this is one of Hollywood's worst disaster movies, not worth more than a 3/10.\",\n",
       " b\"Well, you know... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick both are really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just terrible. The poor actors didn't have material to work with!  The DVD cover invited you to a flight action flick. You would expect something like Top Gun... Huge disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke. The aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources, not made for this movie. And they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models, taking for granted the audience will not notice it.  As I said the story was lame. With a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. In short, it seems a B-movie made in the 70's.  I feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here. They sure must be ashamed.\",\n",
       " b'I\\'m not sure what I can add that hasn\\'t already been said in some of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but Ill try.  So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that \"absorbs\" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. We have the man, in some scenes looking uncannily like Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on, and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.  This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. Who wouldn\\'t want a bed like that? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary \"lasso\" to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they\\'re taking up half the length of the film to try and escape).  Our \"main\" story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). I don\\'t recall exactly, but it doesn\\'t really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she isn\\'t liked by the rest of \"the gang\" and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over, but we don\\'t care; character development was thrown out the window a LONG time before in this film so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast\\'s non-reaction to said noises, cant be heard. This and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats OK....this is Death Bed: The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic so its OK. It makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film If you buy (hehe buy...did I say \"buy\"?) this DVD, make sure to check out the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this \"flick\" started in 1972, didn\\'t wrap up until 1977, he shopped it for a few years with no luck, and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance, on a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasp! cared, about his little-known film. Its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I\\'m glad he did. Once you\\'ve even so much as heard the title to this film, you MUST see it. I for one am going to buy this and I\\'m going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment',\n",
       " b'Once again Bronson\\'s talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. The fact that \"The Evil That Men Do\" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of Bronson\\'s career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. One hopes this fine actor will rise again.',\n",
       " b'Abbott and Costello\\'s talents shine in the happily childish version of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". The use of sepia tone and colour, the music and choreography, song and dance, the crossing over of players from one role to another, plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for \"The Wizard of Oz\" are being toyed with here. And that works right well for our intrepid duo. There are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me ... Buddy Baer\\'s, Max Baer Jr. of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" uncle, appearance as the cop and the giant. Pat Costello, Lou\\'s brother, having been involved in the writing of the script. These things help make this film fun. It does, however, have it\\'s down side. I do think that the choreography is poorly done. But the cute tunes and accompanying vocals help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love ( prince and princess ) to be precise, aren\\'t very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise throughly enjoyable walk down the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... climb up the beanstalk.',\n",
       " b\"This show is actually pretty good. Like all shows on TV, it has its good episodes and its bad ones.  I have read where people compare this show to Married with Children, and I suppose it is a similar show for the new generation. However, because of what was expected and allowed on TV in the days of Married with Children, that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact, a television show, and not meant to be take seriously.  The War at Home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. The parents talk to each other like real life parents often do, telling their children one thing, when they will turn around and do the opposite.  Sure, some of the content can be considered controversial. But I find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are a lot of families out there just like this one.  Every episode does teach a 'valuable lesson'. Its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter, and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble, and hope that they learn right from wrong.  I respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life, instead of having some magical ending like the Cleaver family always had.\",\n",
       " b\"In one of the best of Charlie Chaplin's lengthier short films, he places the Little Fellow in the trenches of WWI, where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life, where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy, and usually to their deaths. It takes someone of Chaplin's skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy, but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing.  Like all of the best of Chaplin's films, short films and otherwise, this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench, erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off, the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater, the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette, and of course, the overtaking of the enemy. All of these scenes are show-stoppers, reminiscent of the most wonderful Chaplin scenes. This one should not be missed!\",\n",

       " b\"Congo is another multi-milion dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc, the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. I'll make this short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. The actors, well it's the best they can do. The script? Try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie. You get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some silly moments, like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her? What sort of twist of common sense is that? Which brings me to this. If there was an annoying character in every movie, Amy ranks of one here. You see Amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her. Neat idea, but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk. Congo is worthwhile to see, and not deplorable, but certainly not a memorable film either.\",\n",
       " b'\"In the Mood for Love\" a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a film without sex, or even kissing -- and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought-provoking and psychological romance I have ever seen.  Telling the story of two people who coincidentally, live in the same apartment, and are a door away from each other. The film, like and unlike \"Random Hearts,\" is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers. Only once they receive this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair, and each other\\'s feelings towards having just broken-up -- and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love.  What\\'s terrific about the film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai, presents each character\\'s way of dealing with loneliness. With Maggie Cheung\\'s character, he\\'ll show her, in a repeated montage: leaving work, going home, watching her neighbors gamble, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop, and bump into her attractive age-equal, played by Tony Leung. This is a clever, if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness. For it is when you are alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.',\n",
       " b'**Warning - this review may contain spoilers **   The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.  However, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.  He has Danny meeting a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). I was stunned, by the way, when I learned Victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.  Amazingly there is no romance between Danny and Victoria.  When Danny turns up again, wounded, what does Sam do but take him straight home. Danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? Nooooo. I don\\'t know if they even called in a doctor.  Now Danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet Sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.  Why Morgan Freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film I can\\'t even begin to guess. Surely Mr. Freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.  Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who \"owns\" Danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that\\'s hard to kill. The car Bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled Bonnie and Clyde\\'s demise. We think he\\'s dead, but no.  Then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol\\' Bart escapes unscathed.  In addition to that, we also have Danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where Danny has decided he doesn\\'t want to fight any more. I don\\'t care how much a person doesn\\'t want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, I think anyone would fight.  As I said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. It\\'s not just a case of suspending belief - it\\'s completely beyond that.  Furthermore I never did understand why Danny\\'s mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute Bart claimed she is, became mixed up with Bart and his gang and got shot. Maybe that was my fault, I got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and Bart would have ever crossed paths.  4 stars out of 10 - and that\\'s being generous.',\n",
       " b'\"Alexander Nevsky\" marked director Sergei Eisenstein\\'s return to film-making after a period of exile, and what he produced is a bald-faced propaganda film proclaiming Russia\\'s superiority over Germany.  There\\'s very little plot: Russians unite to battle Germans; Russia wins. The film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed in with some moments of German brutality (like a rather shocking scene that shows German soldiers throwing Russian children onto a raging fire). This was Eisenstein\\'s first sound film, and it\\'s clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. Indeed, this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added. There are some dialogue scenes, but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen, and the pacing is all off, as if the actors weren\\'t actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them. Eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing Prokofiev score over the proceedings, and indeed, that\\'s one of the film\\'s biggest assets.  Say what you will about Eisenstein\\'s ability (or lack of) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and \"Alexander Nevsky\" over all shines through its deficiencies.  Grade: A',\n",
       " b\"What annoys me with so called 'science' programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a FACT that dinosaurs live 'millions' of years ago. Firstly, nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions/billions of years old. It's a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot.  Secondly, nobody can prove that evolution ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING ! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth, they are complete animals of a certain kind eg: a dog or a cat. Nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur turning into a bird.  This is utter hogwash. There's more proof that Santa Claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal.  All the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it, was created.  This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENCE FICTION.   If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program, then rather watch Star Trek or Star Wars.\",\n",

       " b\"THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Julie and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of Hilary Swank.\",\n",
       " b\"for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.  this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.  i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie. i still love it as much as i did all those years ago.  buy this movie!!\",\n",
       " b\"I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 60's (Time Tunnel etc). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 done 20 years later, but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish).  I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level, but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting (especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro- politics, surprisingly similar to today's European Union!)  The plot is indeed reminiscent of Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed), but in this case it's a compliment.  Great sets, by the way!  7/10\",\n",
       " b\"A mean spirited, repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children. Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo, even though she receives star billing. If your a Julie Brown fan, you'll want to check it out, since she's naked in a couple of shots. All others,avoid.\",\n",
       " b'Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they\\'re pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by\\'s. This film explores the aching pain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the ache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they\\'re playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman\\'s experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the \"normal\" encounter.  The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, pain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it.  I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard\\'s both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.',\n",
       " b'\"Fat Girls\" is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.  The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small TX town. His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits: the class \\'fat girl\\', a na\\xc3\\xafve immigrant from Cuba, and the sensitive drama teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand, peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.  Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced dramedy, Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikeable, derivative, two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel-gazer. She is such a prickly, unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This may have been bad casting, but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. Consequently, one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond, what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.  Sabrina\\'s newfound boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney\\'s mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clich\\xc3\\xa9d stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent \"comedy\" ever made within the realm of TV or film. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus- talk and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death, Christian inserts a scene where Judy\\'s mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?  In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor, there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a \"fat ugly\" loser. However, he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk, Ted (Miller). Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment, most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone, just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.  Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds, the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet, but is conveniently openly gay to boot. Like Sabrina, Bobby is an icy, angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal.   Much to his delight, Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival, the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney\\'s feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. As tiny as the town is, they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men, no less)? Apparently, the place is not so backwater after all.  Ten years earlier, Todd Stephens\\' \"Edge of Seventeen\" covered nearly the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching, and humorous film.',\n",

       " b'This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Rom communities woven together by music. It\\'s very much a musician\\'s film, because of the paucity of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic tale of \"customs, dress, and music\" or a plot-line orbiting a few central characters - don\\'t look for that here.  This is because it paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story through space (India to Andalucia) and/or/ time (we cannot tell) of a people. There is no need of narration. You get a sense of a joyous people, strongly linked in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, at their rejection by society at large.  So it\\'s a paean to Rom culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide spectrum of Rom music, and a sting in the tail which is the oppression these people have faced, and still face.',\n",
       " b'This is a fact that this is the 1st Saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason we don\\'t have cinema theaters in our large kingdom .. not only one cinema theater! The government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the Islamic extremists OR the religious police (or both) asked for closing it in the late 1970s & the early 1980s .. accusing the 7th art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that .. I don\\'t see a powerful reason why we don\\'t open cinema theaters!! .. we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom, we watch movies in the TV from some satellite channels, we can install the \"Showtime\" set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways .. I know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films .. I personally went to Bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home. Saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world, we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town. This is one of the problems that we are having!! ..  The movie is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment which is a major company belongs to the Saudi tycoon-prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the 8th richest man in the world).  The movie\\'s title is a word means literally \"how are you?\" but it is also a slang means \"what\\'s up!\", sometimes used as a slang to say \"bad\" about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business & not to interfere in someone else\\'s affairs. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) & (what\\'s up!) in the same time, I could be wrong though.  Male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in Arabian realty show more like \"American Idol\", he works in some TV programs like the Arabian version of \"Cash Taxi\" .. the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor .. other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and they work on some TV series shows. Female actresses are non-Saudis and they did a very good job speaking the Saudi accent .. Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in leading role & Emeriti actress Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we don\\'t have Saudi actresses but are few and not that good.  A Saudi critic \" Rja Al-Mutairi\" who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom) wrote about it saying: \"lets not expect much of the 1st Saudi feature film. It was born in unusual circumstances therefore we can\\'t judge it under the usual standards like any other film. It is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in Kingdom of Bahrain. The movie is fresh and is about a Saudi family deals (interacts) with controversial fresh issues inside the Saudi society like: women driving cars, the low-shallow thoughts about the arts, the guardianship of the society by a certain group & the differences between being conservative and being an extremist. The ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie. One of the movie\\'s advantages is the beautiful music score by Rajeh Dawood which was good but sometimes it doesn\\'t match or express what\\'s in the picture. Turki Al-Yusuf did a great job .. his performance was the best alongside with Mais Hamdan .. the biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman who came behind the supporting actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles.   after all, \" Keif al-hal?\" even with all of its disadvantages still an OK movie and it is a very good 1st step of Rotana .. and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the Saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other arts\"  PS: there is another Saudi filmmaker \"Abdullah Almohaisen\" claims that he directed the 1st Saudi movie titled \"Shadows of Silence\".

       " b'This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence, sex, and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times, but the use of texture, combined with the extreme contrast, create an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which if extremely rough, but does make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art, or shock value trash is open to discussion.',\n",

Though evil by most people\\'s standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with \"Lethal Weapon\" electric prods.  The movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood\\'s squinter eyes, Dolph Lundgren\\'s one-liners, the acting abilities of JCVD and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.  Martin \"Cobra Kai\" Kove\\'s career shares this low point with Roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if Kove\\'s character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way. I couldn\\'t blame him if he did.  Fortunately for all involved, this movie has a \"so bad that it\\'s good\" quality that can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO.',\n",
       " b\"From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. It stars the now forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. Recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has virtually diminished, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were brought together as a team, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is a shame that he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a film. Once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive.

       " b'Not as bad as some people say...This is a unofficial Bond movie and a remake of \"Thunderball\", written by Kevin McClory (co- producer in \"Thunderball\"). Well, the cast is very very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond- villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the \"original\" Bond- girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and a truly great Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing in the \"M\" role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. Sean Connery does it once more confident and charming, except that he looks a little bit too old. But alright, he is the original Bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. The locations are also typical- Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score, the song \"Never say never again\" is O.K., but the theme song is just missing. All in one, a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly Roger Moore movies like \"Moonraker\". Only if there was another story, \"Thunderball\" was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake',\n",

And you wanna know the worst part? You\\'re from outta state!)  Highlights: The Technics 1500B reel to reel is nice set dressing for audiophiles!

Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play their rears off as usual. (Joe William\\'s guests on vocals. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded \"Route 66\".)

       " b\"Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians, which essentially all there is to this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed. The Indian weaponry comes at the audience non-stop throughout, and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattler is thrown in for good measure. Madison was quite popular as television's Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle rancher who is given his thankless task by the army. For all the film's polish and presentation, the movie was made in just three days.\",\n",
       " b'Warner Brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed, with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we\\'re Americans, we don\\'t run from trouble, we face up to our responsibilities. It also suggests that if you\\'re willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you\\'re un-American. Walter Huston, looking bored, is the frustrated DA, and the \"average American family\" includes such familiar faces as Sally Blane (looking a lot like her sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. Both are regularly crowded out of the frame by Chic Sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian Civil War veteran, ponderously jumping and \"amusingly\" nipping at Prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we\\'re Americans, dag nabbit. His St. Vitus Dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick; it\\'s like Walter Brennan based his entire career on it.

They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these \"professionals\" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it\\'s at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise -- what a waste of film!',\n",
       " b'What could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario. If something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something from the past was brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past.  I really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible, you have to stick to logic.  OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance. All of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well. It was the writing that left them twisting in the wind.  \"Back to the Future\" handled it better.',\n",
       " b\"It is often hard to decide what the best film is that you've ever seen, since this may vary by genre, preferences for actors/actresses, or even the mood you're in on a particular day! Having said that, this movie is by far, in my opinion, the WORST movie I've ever seen!! I thought the acting was terrible (was there any?), the plot was just idiotic, and the props were totally fakey. Could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? I don't think so. Even the friends I watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented, and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie.\",\n",
       " b'Do not be misled. This is NOT a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies, and who rents them all: the good, and the horrendous. Yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it\\'s basically an artsy-fartsy exercise in existentialist dread, which is a long way of saying it\\'s boring. If you\\'ve worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained, rent something else.  \"Rise of the Undead\" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting, and crummy dialogue. All of that is understandable in an indie, low-budget film, and I can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. Unfortunately, \"Rise of the Undead\" hardly has any story at all. Moreover, the acting is not laughably bad so much as non-existent. All of the actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would it have killed them to show some emotion? (And no, yelling does not equate with emoting). The one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first. Granted, there was another character who briefly held my interest. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late.  The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail: film is a VISUAL medium. That means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what\\'s going on. And all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time, but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple, clear fashion -- just look at George Romero\\'s low-budget \"Night of the Living Dead\" to see how it\\'s done superbly. And I know these folks had a small budget, but if you can\\'t hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible, then just go ahead and make a silent movie (then those Buster Keaton wooden faces might actually work).  I will say this for the film: the zombies were creepy. Unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory, the grosser the better, the zombies here were just shuffling, bloody-faced people. It actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore, scarier. That\\'s the reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.  The sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws, \"Rise of the Undead\" does not insult your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart, scary, original movie, and it\\'s a shame that they failed so miserably. If they could just forego the too-fancy editing, buy a few extra lightbulbs, crank up the dialogue, and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to make something really good.  Trust me: do not waste your time on \"Rise of the Undead.\"',\n",

Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he\\'s done, he\\'s ashamed, but he\\'s also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains.

       " b\"During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.  Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels. While still from the low budget, B-movie mold of the 1980s, 'Evil' has tantalizing potential for a great film. Everyone in the production department, however, took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of Bronson's imprint. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson and Thompson's best films, but instead will go down as one of their most average.  This 1984 political thriller/actioner opens in brutal fashion with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British doctor, holding his special training class for political leaders in Surinam. The gray-haired, passive Molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes. In the opening seven minutes, we witness Molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you may expect, the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original VHS release.  Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of Molloch, but turned the offer down. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to talk Holland into finishing the job, bringing videotapes of testimony from The Doctor's victims. While in denial at first, Holland eventually agrees to the dirty work, targeting Molloch and his doting sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala.  Holland enters Guatemala City with help from an adviser, Max Ortiz (Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Enr\\xc3\\xadquez); he poses as a tourist with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's later output, his character knocks off Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with a sleazy American diplomat (John Glover) and his supporting hit-man (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine, where The Doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims.  'The Evil That Men Do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps at American political dealings in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed, 'Evil' is hard-boiled in every sense of the term, as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development. For every plus this film has, there are three or four minuses, resulting from shod craftsmanship.  While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a great concept, the film is never truly more than an excuse for Bronson to wipe out foreign-based scum. In the style of bad pulp fiction, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. Holland, despite being played strongly by Bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him. Where does her love come from, especially after watching Holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before?  The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked of them. Naturally, we never find out what has brought them so close together, how and where their torture dealings started, what Claire's exact role in their business is\\xc2\\x85These plot holes can go on forever, especially with the paint-by-numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation, other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? Is his memory that short? And what really was the purpose, other than cheap theatrics, of Holland throwing Molloch's chauffeur Cillero (Jorge Luke) off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment?  The overall acting is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction is lacking at points, but may have been compromised by limited time on site. Besides Evil's filming in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear through better production values, cinematography, and music. Rural locations are well-used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographer Xavier Cruz provides rich color and clarity. The orchestral score by Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. Oddly enough, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual, although with more laughable continuity errors.  'The Evil Than Men Do' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and I find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans. The DVD from Columbia TriStar Entertainment is an okay presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. While the video quality is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in plain mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality.  ** out of 4\",\n",
       " b'This movie lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as major as it gets. Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62-years of age, I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. Even \"Escape from New York,\" which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn\\'t resort to such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this movie and I have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the \"Escape\" movie. Secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he\\'s killed. Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson\\'s character? This was not a great movie and I could go on, but I won\\'t.',\n",

       " b\"May Contain Spoilers!!! In no way, shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold. Not by a long shot. However, it does deliver a creepy atmosphere, believable enough characters and gore.  The story is simple and doesn't bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to. A bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900's. Since then, they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little PA town in the mountains.  Simple: they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago. Naturally, his great, great, great grandson is in town and he's a real prick.  Along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies. The eldest daughter is rebellious, obnoxious...a typical teen. The younger is curious, bright-eyed and gets in with the ghost children.  The creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim. Excellent acting. It was so spooky! I mean, the Children of the Corn flicks are one thing...but this topped any of those (as for the creepy kids).  Worht a look. I bought it before seeing it and I was not unhappy.

First of all, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. Definite plus. Didn't see that one coming. I didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head, either. If the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, I would have loved it. The beginning showed so much promise.   I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I didn't expect most of what happened, and though I questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch.

       " b'COMING on the heels of that 1970\\'s \"Blackploitation\" Era, CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974) offered audiences a low-key, sincere and everyday people sort of a drama. Offering a far different fair to its audience (which was far more general than those \"Gansta\" flicks); being a down to earth dose of realism that offered a lonely counterbalance to those shoot-\\'em-ups\\'.  REPLACING lead characters that were bad-ass detectives, super-flies and megs/macks/pimps (Take your pick in terminology), was a lone, humble and meek teacher. The academian we speak of is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the one and only lone teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a sort of old time one room school house on an island off the coast of South Carolina.  \"CONRACK\" (Jon Voight), the name that the youngsters dub him finds conditions in the school terribly backward. In addition to the physical properties of this \"Little Red Schoolhouse\", any systematic and progressively graduated educational system was totally absent.  OH yeah, by the way, did we mention that further complications to any successful educational venture were manifested in two incontrovertible facts. Those were that Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white; with almost the entire population of this off-shore cay was black and very poor.  PERPETUATING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education; being the school\\'s Principal, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we are made to understand that the teacher, being the low man on the totem pole, is powerless in most respects to affect any sort of meaningful, long-lasting improvements.  BUT don\\'t you tell a \\'Young Turk\\', such as Pat Conroy, that he can\\'t. (Can\\'t anything, that is). \"Conrack\" spends a year of unorthodox classroom performances and is making real progress; but alas, the strong-headed teacher won\\'t give in and recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is, by law and unbeknownst to him, serving at thee super\\'s pleasure; he disobeys Mr. Skeffington\\'s specific order and prohibition to take his class kids to the mainland of South Carolina on Halloween for some Trick-or-Treating; even going to the brazen act of stopping with them at the Skeffington residence.  NEXT we see a Western Union Telegram messenger happily singing as he crosses from the Carolina mainland to the island; where he delivers the telegram to Conroy that bore the news of his dismissal from his position with that school and district.  NOT BEING one to take his being fired lying down, Pat files suit against Mr. Skeffington, Principal Mrs. Scott and the Board of Education protesting his dismissal as being unlawful. Impartially reviewing both the \"offense\" and the law, the Judge asks Skeffington if there are any lesser punishments that could be substituted for Conroy\\'s being separated from the school system; to which he receives a negative response. Fittingly, the Judge dismisses the suit with his gavel pounding down while saying, \"It\\'s very simple!\"   THE story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the \\'Conrack\\'students see him off to the mainland bound launch, while a phonograph record provides us with BEETHOVEN\\'S 5th SYMPHONY; which had played an important part in the Conroy educational agenda, as well as our story.  IN THE HUMBLE opinion of this writer, the story (which we believe was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the main character the name of its author), was much more than a tale of a localized happening. To both me pal Schultz and meself; this is a sort of depiction of a microcosm that represents the overall deplorable conditions that permeate the Government Schools throughout the entire nation. (Just an opinion)   AS FOR THIS film, it was just one of many movies portraying the stores of common folk; leading their lives of \"quiet desperation\" in the great hinterlands of the country, which lie outside the D.C. Beltway and the urban centers of enterprise and communications situated on either the Atlantic or Pacific Coasts.  IN ITS OWN small way, this is a fine film, which would soon be joined in the film vaults of 20th Century-Fox by such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both being from TCF in 1979).  SEE it if you ain\\'t yet. Recommended by both Schulz and his buddy.*  NOTE: * Why, that\\'s me, of course!   POODLE SCHNITZ!!',\n",
       " b\"Nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other Barker's movies, which never lack originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. Certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. And, not to forget, a nice music score. Well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. I've just seen it again after ten years, and I still find it something to recommend.\",\n",
       " b\"I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it. It seems to be a lesser-known teen horror from the 80's. What struck me were the ways it differed from so many other movies from that era.  The first thing I noticed was how slowly this movie builds. It doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one. It takes its time building the back story, leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen. I was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie. But everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes, and then it gets fairly graphic (this was a bad time to take a snack break--I almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started).  The characters also seem slightly more three-dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks. There conversations were refreshingly level-headed for the most part, as opposed to the over-the-top stereotypes you'd expect. For example, the girl who is the popular, snobby, queen-bee of the clique isn't constantly spouting insults at everyone, but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others.  So, to summarize, I felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what I expected, and a little better made as well. It drew me in, kept me interested, and then let me have it. As I said, it's pretty gory during the finale, but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time. I don't need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.\",\n",

       " b'Bardem is great. Actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do it like this. It is OK that he defends his position on the euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. But doing it like this makes him lose his point: the movie is a false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are advertising material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this mind-sick man who wants to make someone to kill him, not understanding the implications of that. He seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring, love and attention. I think that Amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it I believe is not correct. He could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it.',\n",
       " b'Red spectacles  I loved Avalon, I think This director has made some awesome demented visions of the future. This film however was boring pretentious crap. The opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action amimae style future noir. I feel I got that with Avalon.  With Red Spectacles I was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was. The film barely made sense to me and I could not care less about the people in it. This would all be ok if the film was effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot-suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, it did not watch the film worth watching.  Thumbs down.',\n",
       " b'This is one of the best of the early \"Star Trek\" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the \"Star Trek\" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. Then there\\'s the Romulans: they\\'re the ultimate Federation nemesis. The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they\\'re the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their Vulcanoid features they\\'re clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like \"centurion\" and \"praetor.\" The chain-mail armor is really cool. Familiar guest star Mark Lenard, who went on to play Spock\\'s dad Sorek as well as the Klingon commander in \"Star Trek: the Motion Picture\" is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence Olivier\\'s Crassus in \"Spartacus.\" Also, his questioning of the Empire\\'s unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of \"Gladiator.\" A must both for Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.',\n",
       " b\"This film had a distinct Woody Allen feel about it, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor, or back-handed humor, you probably could find something else to do. If you ARE, however, this is quirky, with some nice twists and a flowing, natural dialog.  The story itself is quite engaging, not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes, but close. I mean that in the best way possible. The intrigues are plenty, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are downright lovable.  I had a great time with this movie.  It rates an 8.3/10 from...  the Fiend :.\",\n",
       " b\"Yeah I watched this mini series with My Mom and dad as a kid. It was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow. I recall it was very well done, and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series. It was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. Although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. I haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however. I would imagine not. They should play it on the history channel or something.\",\n",

       " b\"This HAS to be my guilty pleasure. I am a HUGE fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone. This move has no meat, not substance, no deep thought provoking scenes. Just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown, then so be it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and NOT think. Viva la nudity!\",\n",
       " b'There was some good build up of suspense throughout. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget. We witness occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. Silence would have been golden here. There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering, \"I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother...\" Something tells me there\\'s a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. You decide. Throughout the film I can\\'t seem to find a connection or for that matter, sympathy with the characters, perhaps thats because they don\\'t develop one throughout the film, character that is. There are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters, overshadowed again by some questionable scenes. In one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated, limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger. A definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic.',\n",
       " b'A couple are split apart during a vacation. Early scenes lead us to believe Barney, Jeff Bridges\\' character, has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction. The film plays out some years later where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to solve her disappearance.  The storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film, culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work.  OK here we go. The abduction scene - aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are made to perform a little signed-pet-love-ritual that\\'s drowned in over-sentimentality to the point of nausea. We know they\\'re in love; the \"I do solemnly swear never to leave you\" speech only moments prior was ample thank you. Jeff Bridges\\' robot accent is another example. What is that for? Starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet, he\\'s turned nasty. The entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who, by a rather fortunate twist of fate, has quite miraculous powers of observation. The climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much, much better. It\\'s riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder. I could go on but something positive needs to be said. At a stretch, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance.  The 1988 original of the same name (changed from the Dutch title \\'Spoorloos\\' for English speaking audiences) was recommended to me, only for an online rental company to send me this later Hollywood version by mistake. I was surprised to find both having been Directed by George Sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake. I am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot. Horah for that, but it really doesn\\'t take much doing.',\n",
       " b\"Meh, Sums it all up for me really. Boring story, bland dialogue, dull action scenes (HOW do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring? Do you actually have to TRY to do that?), no real characters etc. Just dull. Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work, when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action, fights, shootouts, etc. How can it be that hard to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man etc? Awesome, intense performances complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supporting casts and wicked action.  None of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover, knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.  I'd love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. Together they would all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.  Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, which chews, but it still really sucks.\",\n",
       " b\"Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party. At that time Russell Crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming..... amazing...

       " b\"Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers. I really enjoyed it watching. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80s feel, this is the one that you have to see. I'ts a same that I didn't know of it earlier.\",\n",
       " b\"I love so much about this movie: the music, the cinematography, the acting, the story, and all the Mormon clich\\xc3\\xa9s. Just because they are clich\\xc3\\xa9s doesn't mean they aren't true! This is not perfect, it is a movie after all. Though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs, it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark, cold scene they did in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought that was so cool. I mean, I believe that angels do watch over us. What is one supposed to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake, and cried every time! It blows me away. And I've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theatre in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at General Conference time, as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense intended).\",\n",
       " b'I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. Character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. This is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. I am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.',\n",
       " b'In 1967 I saw an outstanding Musical at the Wintergarden in New York City where Angela Lansbury lite the stage as Mame. But did Hollywood give her the lead ???? No Lucille Ball great as Lucy was given the role. She killed the film. What a mistake There was no chemistry as there was on the stage Bea Arthur and Angela what a twosome when they sang.. It is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today',\n",
       " b\"This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted. Jeremy's wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.\",\n",
       " b'Although it\\'s been hailed as a comedy-drama I found \"Crooklyn\" to be mostly depressing. It\\'s hard to imagine how Spike Lee could look back affectionately on so much chaos, petty cruelty, irresponsibility and mean-spiritedness.',\n",
       " b'Sometime ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could\\'ve produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a \"real\" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty\\xc2\\x85 and with the \"big cocks and tits\". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes that he has found the new star for his films. And that\\'s how the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins.  The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of Eddie\\'s life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them will taste the real success with Dirk as the main star, winning lots of prizes and helping Jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his firsts \"real\" films. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the \"horrible 80\\'s\" when there is going to be $ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society\\'s bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. In Dirk\\'s decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there\\'s a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. Is funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but there\\'s always a solution if you get back in what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back.  Well I haven\\'t mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but I must say that all are amazingly well developed. The cast is just superb with the best performance that I have seen of Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc are just memorable, all of their characters with funny and sad moments.  Finally, I really love the amazing cinematic style of Anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70\\'s and early 80\\'s. I used to say that \"Magnolia\" was my favourite of Anderson but right now, after watching all except \"Sidney\", I can\\'t say that I have a favourite because I love them all!  PS: somewhere I read that this film is the \"Scorsese film\" of Anderson so I\\'m more than sure that if you love \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino\" you will love this one too. I f*cking love \"Boogie Nights\"!',\n",

       " b'To sum it up in a nutshell, this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes.  The acting was sub-par, the only decent actors of the bunch being Trisha, the killer and Molly. The music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused. The story/scriptwriting was poor, the unnecessary torture/romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending.  The start of the film was rather slow, the fake-looking gore not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house, and there was some premise for a good storyline.  Trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls, which heightened the suspense. This momentary suspense, the best feature of the movie began to build, but then the friends crashed the place, wrecking all potential suspense/horror in the film.  The plot then becomes obtuse from here on. Chemistry sparks between the two couples, and then the killer picks off Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged on and unnecessary.  The killer then makes her way for Trisha and ties her up. There is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long. As the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all, and it bores more than shocks.  In summary, the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film.  3/10.',\n",
       " b'The story, as I understand, is \"based on real events.\" That can be either good or bad, depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.  In this case, the results are enough to gag a maggot. I wasn\\'t expecting much going in -- anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. That is, what I figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, \"My duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways.\" Well, it IS that, in a way. The kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. But this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie I\\'ve ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. Who WROTE this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. The dialog offends the ear.  Jeff Bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing extra to the part, although given his lines, it\\'s hard to know how he could do much with them. The rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. There\\'s a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. The best scene involves a dolphin.  The immature clich\\xc3\\xa9s continue to the very end. The Coast Guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but hit Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. \"You let the crew drink alcohol, didn\\'t you?\" (A couple of harmless drinks.) \"And you didn\\'t punish them, though you punished them for killing a fish.\" (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. What is a \"white squall\" anyway? And if it\\'s as dangerous as Bridges claims, why weren\\'t the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests? But why go on? If \"The Albatross\" were a Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic-book script.',\n",

The creature itself looks a bit dodgy and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still dabbling in creating life-forms out of corpses (one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at perfecting his technique still) but Ms. Neri does look good in and out of costume and reliable Herbert Fux probably comes off best as a lecherous grave-robber/blackmailer.',\n",

It feels as if in the middle of the script, the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected.  A 3/10 ....',\n",
       " b'Very nice movie! I was browsing the channels on my TV and I usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then I saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where I saw this movie. At first, when I saw the title \"The Cure\" I thought it\\'s gonna be boring but then I got hooked when I saw Brad Renfro was in this movie (because of one of my favorite movie of all time is \"The Client\" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes was getting better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried hard in this movie which I don\\'t usually do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines/quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard! Now, I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!',\n",
       " b'This is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence { just like Curse of Frankenstein from 1957} . If you don\\'t like odd, non-mainstream films, steer clear of this masterpiece. For me, the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete. The storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today. For being produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with Big government and Big brother wanting to control and monitor us.  There are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes { thats why I\\'ve watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, it may prove to be well worth your time.  The film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism . They are only concerned about accumulating and procreating. The hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been \" tagged\" and monitored by big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity.  Yes, its very low budget, but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating. If you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.',\n",
       " b'Daniel Percival\\'s \"Dirty War\", a BBC production made for television was shown recently on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people that caused the near holocaust in one of the big metropolis of the world, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004 is almost a cautionary tale of the events of the following year, in which terrorists set explosive devices in the public transport that killed innocent people that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time.  The film impresses for the pace the director and the production team gave to the project. There are no dull moments in the movie as we watch the preparation by the terrorists and the people that are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it\\'s amazing just to think what would be the consequences if a real \\'dirty bomb\\' was planted in such a densely populated area.  The last images of the film have a chilling effect. The mob scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated send shivers of fear, thinking how it could possible happen anywhere.',\n",

Unbeknownst to them, the mansion harbors a cellar door - the gateway to hell. If you are in the mood for a clich\\xc3\\xa9d horror film, then look no further, but if you want something inventive, then this little film won\\'t appeal to you.  VIOLENCE: $$$ (Rather subdued, albeit the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw - rather gruesome mind you. Fans of inventive deaths scenes will not like this as every character seems to be electrocuted in some fashion).  NUDITY: $ (Nothing to speak of. Mary Louise Weller adds the good looks but her character was underdeveloped).  STORY: $$ (Cliched, but view-worthy nonetheless. This offers nothing new to the genre but the casting of Victor Buono - who is about as menacing as a department store Santa - seems to have attracted a few viewers).  ACTING: $$ (The best performances are by Crenna and Pettet with the other actors simply \"phoning-in\" their roles. The screenwriter fails to develop any characters outside Pettet\\'s character and seemed to have forgotten about Mary Louise Weller (Animal House) who disappears for about twenty minutes and only resurfaces to be electrocuted like everyone else in boring fashion).',\n",

Everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality. Camera-work, editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing. The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed.  This movie just blew me away.  The \"Showdown\" could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though.  It\\'s a near to perfect homage to early silent noir Films story, acting, scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film-making.',\n",
       " b\"Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life, huh.  The film-making here was incredibly meticulous, every piece of framing, every deadpan stare, every element of the colour palette, every snippet of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this world's calm emptiness.  In fact, I think I might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable. Like when Andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door, it's a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, seeing more of them than the folk you love, but ultimately knowing deep down they don't give a damn about your troubles and you the same.  This might have been a film the Coens had made had they been born in Oslo and not Minnesota. I think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in cinema's past but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty inconsequential.  I'll stop before I talk myself into taking a bus into the wintry wilderness.\",\n",
       " b'It\\'s important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The *buzz that has been generated on this site far surpasses the real impact of the movie. What may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is --not supposed to be scary--. It is pure camp and an attempt at fun. It is not --funny--, just campy. Don\\'t expect something like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; nor something like Friday THE 13TH (Part II through infinity).  HATCHET does possess passable actors. The cinematography is straight Ed Wood. Creature effects and make-up are silly - probably on purpose. Gore and blood is something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a movie of betweenness. It\\'s between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It\\'s between campy and comedy (there\\'s a difference). It\\'s between ultra violent and violent comic book.  Instead of \"capturing the essence of American Horror,\" or whatever other silly jargon that has been used to describe the movie, it tries to capture something between seminal --American-- Horror like Friday THE 13TH and new Horror like SHAUN. It thankfully stays away from Torture Horror.  In the end HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie.  *I think it is happening more and more that people involved in movies are flocking to sites like IMDb to rate and comment on the movies that they are involved with. At very least there is campaigning going on for people associated with the associates to leave positive feedback and ratings. There is no other reason for this movie to have stared out in the high 7s with 600 votes and quickly fall after wide release. This movie is on just better than the HorrorFest releases and should not be so bloated.',\n",
       " b'I am willing to tolerate almost anything in a Sci-Fi movie, but this was almost intolerable. While a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no \\'battlespace\\' rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. The acting (wooden), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with \"hand-to-hand\" combat scenes funnier than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this film bores. The plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love of Sci-Fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.',\n",
       " b\"This two disc set is incredible! If you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live, then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth (second only to Slowfingers himself), He puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film. John Paul Jones, although not as up front as Page, puts on one hell of a show. Although in the live atmosphere, his rythmic bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs like Dazed and Confused, or What is and What Should Never Be), but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these DVD's. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, his beats stand out like no other, and this DVD is proof. Last, but not least, Robert Plant wails like no other can wail. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll be wondering the same thing as Page was when he first met Robert Plant, why the hell isn't this guy already famous? And so concludes my review, sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes, Zeppelin rocks.\",\n",
       " b'Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (voice of Eva Gabor) is the well polished single mother cat of three little kittens. When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O\\'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O\\'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O\\'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O\\'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone\\'s guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from \"Alice In Wonderland\" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse.   Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable \"Everybody Wants To Be A Cat\" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if this was being made now, it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the divide between well bred & well fed Duchess and the street born O\\'Malley.',\n",
       " b'Why was this movie made? Are producers so easily fooled by sadists that they\\'ll give them money to create torture methods such as this so called \"film\"? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but \"Cave Dwellers\" is pushing it. It\\'s seriously physically painful to watch. The plot is something about a dude name Ator - a buffed-up numbnuts whom I will refer to as Private Snowball for the rest of this review - who has to fight invisible warriors and rescue a princess in order to beat the bad guy who needs to find a better hair stylist. I might have gotten the plot wrong since it\\'s been a while since I watched this excrement, but really, do you care that much? Oh yeah, Private Snowball also has a mute Asian sidekick (who hasn\\'t?). Who\\'s not funny.  Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king so personality-free he makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a hang-glider (yes, I\\'m serious) and gets the girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It\\'s cheap, unintentionally silly, and mind-numbingly dull. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up making porn?  Bottom line: AVOID. Ator will steal a part of your life and you will have no funny \"so-bad-they\\'re-good\" catchphrases to take with you from the experience. Bad Ator! BAD! Aak! *gags*',\n",
       " b\"The only positive thing I can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I ever saw was called.  It would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable...a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even.   Why would anyone want to produce such waste?   I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented.   Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point.   Anything else just doesn't make sense.\",\n",
       " b'Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn\\'t fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.  I believe that this is the first feature by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it\\'s a great start! I saw elements of other directors\\' influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.  Character development is the movie\\'s finest feature. I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).  Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the \"racy\" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.',\n",
       " b'Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don\\'t mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I\\'ve ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you\\'ll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I\\'ll put the characters in order of favoritism:   Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor\\'s best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo\\'s nephew but for Mogambo, he\\'s more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, \"A Fraud and a Cheat!\"). Now, Gogo\\'s only goal is to get back what\\'s his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo\\'s struggle against the sinner-world.  Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj\\'s twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night\\'s darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena\\'s Dad), though Teja doesn\\'t regret his actions. Teja\\'s sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit\\'s clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!)   Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father\\'s cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena\\'s father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.  Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.  I won\\'t reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn\\'t stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.  The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn\\'t go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there\\'ll be a second ride after that... and then a third!  The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn\\'t have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!',\n",
       " b\"This movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst films I've ever seen. And coming from me, that is definitely saying something. In fact, I wish I could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one-star awful.  When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and I have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks. But I draw the line at this one.  The acting sucked. The lead male gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines. The lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance, but that really doesn't take much.  The chupacabra... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. It does, however, look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. The mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person, but not so on screen.  Speaking of on screen, you'd think they could have at least used a better camera. It looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud. Not a very good one, either.  I don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking. The dialog sucks and just... I can't describe what I feel about it. At least not without getting in trouble with the site.  My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's just not worth it. If it comes on TV and you have nothing else to do or watch, then *find* something else to do or watch. Read a book, listen to music, *anything.* Just don't subject yourself to this. If you do, you cannot say you weren't warned. And for Lord and Lady's sake, don't rent this sucker. It is not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.\",\n",
       " b\"I rented the DVD in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But it's pretty much just more terror-tainment.  While the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you're taking the word of the producers - there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. Not one.  The acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of 'hot shot' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. There may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad Hollywood stereotype smell to it.  IMDb's user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and I have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever I can.  I wish I had on this one.\",\n",

That\\'s because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it\\'s time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.  Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being \"among the best\" and gave it scores of 10. If this is the case, then why is it that everyone I know who has seen this episode hates it as much as I do? It\\'s possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but it\\'s also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode.  The episode itself stars William Windom and others as various archetypes--a soldier, a dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the \"shocking truth\"--which isn\\'t at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame. No, this is a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes, there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10, but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution.',\n",

Don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action/animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored.This is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974.\",\n",

If you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what REALLY goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out.

Kristy McNichol\\'s film career took a real hit after this, while leading man Christopher Atkins cannot get a grip of any particular emotion, his voice wobbling about in search of an appropriate tone. You have to wonder, if that\\'s the best title they could come up with, what\\'s the level of wit going to be in the actual script? The movie\\'s \"Grease\"-like affection for musicals doesn\\'t gel with its penchant for slapstick a la \"Airplane!\", although McNichol works overtime being effervescent and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing.

I can\\'t say much more or I will spoil the experience for a new, young audience who might just be coming out. Another fine work for Sarah Waters. It also is a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another Sarah Waters work, in \"Tipping the Velvet\".. It is also a must see..',\n",

He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T.V. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn\\'t claim to be anything to sophisticated. The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of \"Highway to Heaven\" and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don\\'t even get any satisfaction from Bronson\\'s revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend.',\n",

You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.  The film is good for some laughs though. Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie.  2/10 for unintentional comedy.  Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.',\n",
       " b'Although it can be VERY tedious at times, this movie is really not all that bad. The acting is fairly well done, if stereotypical, and the production values are pretty high considering some of the Sci-Fi movies that were to come later in the decade.  My biggest problem with this film are some of the very outdated characterizations in it. There\\'s the guy from Texas, the \"professional\" scientist, and worst of all the woman scientist who finally realizes her womanhood. For a film seeking to make a statement about mankind, it loses some of it\\'s impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.',\n",

I must stress that I've only had the Cockney Filth imposed on me during visits from my children, who insist on watching the Sunday omnibus. My god, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other, but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be. The reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot-on. If anyone lived in a social environment like this, they'd slash their wrists within days. And I can assure anyone not familiar with the real East End that it's rather more 'ethnically enriched' than you'll ever see here. Take my advice - avoid this nadir of the British TV industry.

       " b\"The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose, one may ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.  It starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only till the heroine forces herself upon them. Not once but twice. After a pause in the 'Movement', the next hurdle for these 3 is the Emergency imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. Lots of political figures roam around for no obvious reason. The sub-plots are too contrived and don't add up to make a logical whole.  The movie tries to impose a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm. Barely coherent at times, there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arcs of the 3 ex-college buddies. Even after they are presumably married, engaged, settled or whatever, they are ever too eager to just ditch it all and head off to a village to have sex with the ex-lover or ex-flame. What fertile imagination the screen-writer possesses. So many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusive!!  Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that she doesn't try to hide. Its hideous hearing her mouth clich\\xc3\\xa9-ridden dialog like 'Whats up? I didn't think you'd come' (this, after the hellish nightmare she's just been thru) or, in the beginning, 'I appreciate your concern but I can take care of myself'. Yikes. What kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this? She invites her friend in to have a cup of 'South Indian' (no less) coffee, wishes someone Good Morning and then is wished Good Night by someone else in the family. Now whats up with THAT?!?  The countless uncredited villagers and tribals are the best actors. The editing is really erratic with too many cuts. Obviously trying hard to make a bold statement, Sudhir Misra screwed up big-time on this one.\",\n",

I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say, after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked behind me and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen, lost in thought. This will make you delve deep into your psychological abyss to ponder several things:  How much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation?

I am still lost in thought, attempting to answer my many questions from the film. I enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. This film is not trying to answer questions, condone any action or promote any punishment. This movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the rose colored glasses that most of us view the world through.  Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars\",\n",

While she\\'s out taking care of family matters she\\'s replaced by Eckhart.  Unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she\\'s a dead fish and he\\'s okay, but not much of anything). Watching this I was wondering why anyone would want to see this since Zeta-Jones\\' character is so unlikable.

       " b'Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film. Perhaps inspired by \"101 Dalmatians\" with its smart and loyal dogs, its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly \"happy\" and predictable ending, the alternate title \"101 Turkeys\" springs to mind. That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. I dismissed it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British customs before learning, to my horror, that it actually is a Canadian film, done in Victoria BC, that phony British theme park of a town, while sucking tax dollars out of Ottawa ON, that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The dizzy plot? The asinine script? The dismal performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clich\\xc3\\xa9s and predictable slapstick? On second thought, neither I nor those browsing the IMDb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings. Yet were I to detail its merits, this space would remain blank. Trust me, it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have seen it already, my condolences. If you have not, stay away from it as you would SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Don\\'t even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed, fabricated and filmed this frightful folly. Perhaps tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as I flee in frantic flight. I hope so. It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. But then, I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night, trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. Maybe \"Godzilla\" or \"Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes\" Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.',\n",
       " b'Oh yes, I have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. The acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. None appear to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the film editors asleep?  The costumes appear authentic to the Regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and I don\\'t believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk.   Also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have \"big hair\"---especially the woman playing Anne Elliot.  All the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely but this doesn\\'t make up for the lack of acting abilities. The actress playing \"Anne\" looks as though she is in her forties while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing Anne believable? She spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. I wonder still what that was suppose to convey. Regret perhaps? Yes, this production is regrettable!  The actress playing Louisa was truly appalling. She screams, squeals, giggles, and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that I found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. How this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. Most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.  The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.  The rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that is certain. No, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film.   I rate this production two stars: one because it is Austens\\' work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could watch the entire production is that I was off sick with the flu and I got it from the library.   If you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film even if you have\\'t read the book.',\n",

It follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son.

       " b'Barely three and a half years after just scraping out a month\\'s run (7-31 Oct. 1953) at Broadway\\'s Coronet Theatre (on west 49th Street; since renamed the O\\'Neill), MGM relied on the earlier solid London success of the play to lavish a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully \"opened up\" production on a sadly trimmed down screenplay of this slyly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hit.  Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and entirely complacent \"workaholic\" (before the term had been coined) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to attempt to rekindle passion in her spouse. When the \"second honeymoon\" cruise Gardner inveigles Granger into leaves the trio (and Granger\\'s dog) marooned on a south sea island (were there other survivors? That\\'s for later plot developments), Granger continues right on managing the world around him - building a big hut for himself and his wife and a little one of the title for Niven - or the unattached male.  The core of the actual plot of the play only gets going about half way through the film when Niven proposes that Granger and he alternate as tenants of the Little Hut - sharing the only female on the island as Granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes (his).  Reason (which Granger considers his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while.  David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their appointed roles of suave would-be seducer and seductress, and Stuart Granger - usually called upon merely to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specialty (a crowing pretty-boy as Apollodorus in Shaw\\'s CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as the husband who may actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he would again show this suave urbanity opposite Rex Harrison in Granger\\'s first (and BOTH their last) Broadway engagements in a hit revival of Somerset Maugham\\'s THE CIRCLE which only ended with Harrison\\'s death. We\\'d be far richer if Granger had used these skills more often.  As promising as the menage is, this is, after all, a very British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950\\'s which is to say that (unlike the source play) very little sex actually goes on. To be frank, if you don\\'t give yourself over to the ideas driving the contrivances it does get a bit silly (the same basic plot is far more satisfyingly developed three years later in the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr/Robert Mitchum/Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger\\'s actual wife) THE GRASS IS GREENER, based on an even less successful play, but for some reason that superior trifle failed at the box office).  As lavishly as MGM set the piece, there were unfortunate lapses - the silliness which ends the stay on the island is cartoonishly presaged in what should have been a moment of genuine excitement - the sinking of the yacht that PUTS them on the island. Ultimately we only get about three quarters of an hour of the real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger that make the film a fun diversion. Not high culture, but a worthy guilty pleasure.  We even get some very nice garnish in Walter Chiari (reputed to be Ava\\'s actual lover at the time). As one of his better speeches goes: \"Boola, boola!\"',\n",
       " b'And I may be being generous. The overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footage...the shambling monster, two women exercising, the shambling monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the shambling monster again, none the worse for wear despite having been injured...you get the picture. I restrained myself from yelling \"GET ON WITH IT ALREADY\" on several occasions.  And it doesn\\'t help that the footage they used was poorly produced. The sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. And in the one scene where they tried to get \"artistic\" with the lighting and camera techniques, the lighting guy, holding the flashlight that provides the scene\\'s only illumination, is clearly visible in the shot.  My hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyways, cobbled together from the editing room floor, in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the *real* film - the one with the plot and the interesting dialog. Sadly, there\\'s no evidence of this, and I\\'m forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of Joel and the Bots, they just didn\\'t care.  ',\n",
       " b\"This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.  There are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:  Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!!  Aaron: He must be good looking Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!  The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks, and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this film.\",\n",
       " b\"I don't understand the people here. The film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here. Except for De Kok the acting is OK. The problem with the film is mainly the script. The characters are not believable. The sex is done okay, but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense. The film doesn't look good, but what do you expect? The film was shot for very little money on video. Off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film, duh! The one thing I do agree on is that the music is bad. Sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the '80's. The film is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money.\",\n",
       " b\"Laughed my ass off but probably because I was stoned. That aside ... this is in no way a horror movie, there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid. On top of that, I am living in Denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that Denmark is way too small a country that you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you got lost. I would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot. Secondly I don't think any part of the movie, apart from two shots from Copenhagen where none of the actors were in, were actually taped in Denmark. The bog woman is talking Swedish not Danish. The helmet on the first bog body is brand new. The girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in Denmark. This is just stupid.\",\n",
       " b\"I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.  Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. Cops get lucky also. Capt Drebin (notice he's a Captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of force, perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes.  The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the sight gags,however. At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground, with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Python's And Now For Something Completely Different.....  If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3, or Top Secret, then you will definitely enjoy this.   I always liked the series better than the movies, even though I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words : No O.J.\",\n",

Chapter Two: Three Years Of Inglorious Basterds In Sixteen Minutes... Without Tables (Mostly)  In which an American Lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man Jewish- American commando unit. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler, three years later. He is angry at his men's inability to deal with the Basterds. Hitler does have a table. We return to the Basterds in a flashback. Again, distinct lack of table-based content.   Chapter Three: German Night in Paris... At A Table... Talking  In which a Jewish woman who escaped from under the table in Chapter One has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an Actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, the Actor, Joseph Goebbels and a Translator talk at a table in a Restaurant. The Actor and Goebbels talk in German. The Translator translates the German into French. The Jewish woman replies in French. The Translator translates the French into German. Goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the Jewish woman's cinema. The Actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi (who talked with the Dairy Farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in Chapter One) arrives. He talks with the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman breaks down; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table.   Chapter Four: Operation Table Talking  In which Austin Powers sends a British Officer to join the Basterds and an Actress on a mission to talk in German at a table in a Tavern. After 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.  Chapter Five: Revenge of the Giant Table  In which, The Basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in Italian and suicide bombing the cinema. The Nazi takes the Actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe that he found under the table in the Tavern fits her so he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a big room, where they sit and talk at a table. Meanwhile, the cinema burns down, Hitler is riddled with bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.  The End\",\n",

The cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. The running time is made up not in the classic Ed Wood style of using stock footage. Instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action. And as for The Roller Blade Seven aren't even seven of them!  You must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be. Giving independent film makers everywhere hope.\",\n",

Lets start with the one thing I really did not like about this movie.... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this B movie.  The best thing was John Rhys-Davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.)John was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say, he said it well.Good job given what he had to work with.The Cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch too,he had some funny bits.The marines all were OK and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests.There are a few pretty funny lines in this movie,and a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief.  The special effects are generally med to low and I swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. I did like the gore of the legless man.Really since this movie was not scary at all I feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie.  All in all if you like B monsters this one is worth a visit.',\n",
       " b\"I'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which I can deal with when it comes to zombie films. However, what I didn't count on is this film being really, really boring; if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. I'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films I've seen from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things just doesn't cut it. The plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!  The plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what I didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing. The opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. I can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you're going to spend so long on it, you've really got to make it interesting. All of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. The film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but Bob Clark already did it with this film. The direction isn't bad either, but it's brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies. Overall, I really can't recommend this film; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.\",\n",
       " b'What a disappointment. The story line is so simple - \"the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things\" - dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever, sophisticated and meaningful. It isn\\'t. It lacks any subtlety.  Everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation.  For a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character\\'s actions.  Half way through I really wanted to waste no more time on it, but I thought I would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it simply got worse.',\n",
       " b'I don\\'t recall a film which so deftly shows the emotional destruction of war, as mirrored in one single marital relationship. The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow--the two are in every scene. Through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal--one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. The characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness--the camera pulls out and away, sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars. The confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers, but this is all purposeful under the master hand of Bergman. I think the use of a \"fake\" war makes the film timeless, as relevant today as ever before, and by focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone. The pair could be anyone. The film is not grounded in place or time, but rather in emotion. A unique and effective war film, unlike any other. Bergman\\'s films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships--that he would bring this to a war film is masterful.',\n",
       " b'Follow-up to 1965\\'s \"My Name Is Barbra\", and shot in brilliant color, \"Color Me Barbra\" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She\\'s a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she\\'s also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (\"One Kiss\", \"Yesterdays\"). The circus sequence isn\\'t as intriguing as the museum trip (with the conceit of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings, an idea which works better than you may think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word \"face\"!) is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special--not quite as emotionally tantalizing as \"My Name Is Barbra\", but certainly a sterling sophomore effort.',\n",

All that aside, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in American cinema), and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok, except Demi Moore).  Yes, it's immature, yes, it's screw-ball, yes, Bobcat dresses up like Godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. It's also funny as hell. Watch it.\",\n",
       " b'In watching Enterprise for the first time, as we all no doubt do with all shows, I went into it with an open mind, enjoying about half of the past Star Trek efforts and disliking the other half.  Enterprise has fallen short, but this episode \"A Night In Sickbay\" made me seriously question why I bother tivoing the shows from Monday night on Sci Fi.  Masking some idea that it is one of those \\'A Day In The Life\\' episodes, in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids, the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel, not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes.  A planet, especially one whose people had been offended previously by the Enterprise crew (for eating in public), was no place for a dog. As an animal lover myself, I would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense.  But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures, as tho they are offering some insight into American religious zealots.  The aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree, yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult.  Strange how the dog\\'s urinating wasn\\'t regarded as some form of worship. I wonder how that one got by the show\\'s writers.  From there, we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties. In watching the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the ship\\'s captain.  He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we aren\\'t supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows.  The doctor non-chalantly clips long, hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals. Ewwwwww! Then a white bat creature escapes.  Oh, how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on! Toenail clipping, for crying out loud! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented.  Then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with T\\'pol, and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog.  Endless amounts of rubbish.  \"your dog is ill, so go have sex. You\\'ll feel better.\" And of course, the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous, because we are so (everyone smile very sarcastically) narrow-minded! Saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on TNG.  Oddly enough, the only thing missing from this awful episode was that Trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms, tho Bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog.  Oh, the dog survived, so now go play fetch.',\n",
       " b'Andy Milligan, the independent movie maker from New York, directs this little \"treat\" as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well-informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty. Milligan, for my money, has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all-time race. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles in comparison. This movie is so bad in oh so many ways. Let\\'s take Milligan\\'s direction for starters. The film quality is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan was using a camcorder to film. The credits say \"Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan.\" He wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene? How about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? The film cuts with one poor transition after another. Little logic is used in the creation of the plot. The story has little to do with the actual legend of Todd. The murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. Hands, legs, and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: choppily! And let\\'s take the breast in the pie scene. Yes, it is in there. The pie maker didn\\'t know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust? Later we hear from our characters that they \"have been careful not to get caught\" for the 200 plus murders they have done. Obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on(sorry it was too tempting). The actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. Some even have glimmers of talent, and all seem to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced throughout. Milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex. Plot strands are left untied. The ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like anything about the film? Not much to be truthful. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick.',\n",
       " b\"Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn't even pay close attention. Just more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor, but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh, there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still, there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job. Lastly, the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and LOVED it. Just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow, BURN!!! - Captain J\",\n",
       " b'Of all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, after seeing all the great, mind boggling, thought provoking stories, this one stands on top. That\\'s right. This story, this one entitled THE HUNT tops the large number of the finest scripts in Television History.  True, there are no interplanetary space flights, no inexplicable cracks in time. There is no living nightmare, no sudden changes of setting. There is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with.  The main character, played by veteran character actor Arthur Hunnicut, sets out from his cabin in the hills, accompanied by his faithful hound, to hunt raccoon. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight.  The man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon, who hops on the dog\\'s back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond. The man jumps in to help his dog. There is a sort of almost black-out, after which the pair are seen on the shore, in a lying, almost sleep like position.  Calling his dog by name, (Rip, I think) the old man sets off to return home. When he arrives, he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. He also observes visitors coming and going to his house, paying respects and giving words to console his wife.  Still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the Home Cabin, the Man and Rip take off on a long walk down the road, where He remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. He eventually comes upon a rather large fellow, dressed in garb similar to his-overalls, hat, work shirt. They are at a gate, which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up. The Gate Keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter. Rip sounds displeasure. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he may enter, but the dog would have to remain outside, offering to watch the animal for him. The man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path.  After a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the Gate Keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him. When the Old Man reports what has happened down the road, telling him of how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the Man and dog, and added, \"With no dogs allowed, that must be a Hell of a place!\" The 2nd Gate Keeper stated that he was right! \"That\\'s exactly what it is!\"   Our family had lost our 1st Dog, Lady-a mixed Lab, in October of 1981. About 6 months later, as good fortune would have it, the Wife(Deanna) and myself along with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) viewed this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, it all made perfect sense to us at that time.  We\\'re certain that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog, would agree. The episode still brings a condition of watery eyes to this now 60 year old writer.',\n",
       " b\"There's simply no redeeming quality about this film. OK, some of the costumes are OK, but they're nothing you can't see in, say, the Conan flicks. And what's up with Ator's hair? I can't believe this is part of a series! I will say one thing about this film: it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of MST3K and I suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.\",\n",
       " b\"I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.  The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles. One of the best movies ever, hands down.\",\n",
       " b'Take someone you love or want to love and go see this film.  It touches you in all the right places.  All the other reviewers here have said it all.  Perhaps the cynical will not be impressed.  They only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days.  This film is Ga-run-teed to stay with you for life.  I am so gratified that the Director is not USC trained.  This validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days.  It is because of the USC lockstep mentality and inbreeding.  Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well Done!',\n",
       " b\"This was truly horrible. Bad acting, bad writing, bad effects, bad scripting, bad camera shots, bad filming, bad characters, bad music, bad editing, bad casting, bad storyline, bad ... well, you get the idea. It was just, just ... what's the word? Oh yeah ... BAD!\",\n",
       " b\"The club scenes in this film are extremely believable, Tim Curry is in his most venal mode, and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies, maybe even three. What more do you require from an evening's entertainment? Pump up the volume.\",\n",
       " b\"I thought the movie was pretty good. I really enjoyed myself as I viewed it. However, the last scene at Johnny's birthday party was cut way too short. I, myself, was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results. But other than that, (and the weird casting), the movie was superb.\",\n",
       " b'All the comments so far about this movie are negative but I have to say I found \"The Net\" engaging. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did. Another plus for it is that most action/suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity. I found it an enjoyable movie to watch. I am slightly biased though, being a big Sandra Bullock fan. *wink*',\n",
       " b\"This is just dreadful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.  An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and that's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. It's very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched: the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all!! And thus totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it. Whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time. Even the ending was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.\",\n",
       " b\"I loved this movie. It's a lot of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I'd rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeating and repeating themselves.  It's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a ten line minimum? I'm not a critic, just a patron.  I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from beginning to end. >\",\n",
       " b'Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man, wrongly accused, on the run (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first one being \"The 39 Steps\", which really made him popular in Great Britain. It really is his signature theme.  Others include \"Young and Innocent\", \"Saboteur\", \"Spellbound\", \"Stage Fright\", \"Strangers on a Train\", \"I Confess\", \"To Catch a Thief\", \"The Wrong Man\", \"North by Northwest\", and finally \"Frenzy\". \"Saboteur\" starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his co-worker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. He meets up with model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during his run from the law, and later, of course, the various Nazi/Fascist sympathizers along the way.  \"Saboteur\" is mainly like \"The 39 Steps\", even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who doesn\\'t trust the main character in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland, and in the other California to New York), and meeting the \"colorful\" locals along the way. And so, just like \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock\\'s earlier works.  I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American, sort of an \"everyman\" with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is a more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in \"The 39 Steps\" and Ruth Roman in \"Strangers on a Train\". As mentioned elsewhere, though, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser\\'s performance as the blind uncle; his lines are great. There are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief, such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane\\'s character on them, and circus sideshow performers, and the truck driver, Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there aren\\'t too many characters who believe Barry Kane\\'s innocence immediately.  There are some slow parts, mainly when the action first moves to New York, but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists gets underway.  It\\'s one of my favorite films from Hitchcock (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home.  It makes you think, \"Could my coworker be involved in something evil?\" In fact, one of the movie posters for \"Saboteur\" proclaimed \"Watch Out for the Man behind your back!\" Imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the Second World War.',\n",
       " b'I was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television... and sorely disappointed at the end result.  The only \"amazing\" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the cable). I didn\\'t think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. You could tell they were two different actors.  Granted, I can also spot in the modern Spider-Man movies when I am looking at Tobey Macguire and when I am looking at CGI. But that is from a trained eye and experience working with CGI. Still, the 70\\'s version could have been better despite lack of Special FX.  The webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them. And what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in. Hello? He\\'s the web slinger people.  Sorry... didn\\'t mean to get so worked up, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.',\n",
       " b'What is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it?   Carlos Mencia is no George Lopez. There IS a difference. When watching comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to pattern his show as the \"Hispanic/Latino/Spanish\" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not do a \"Block Party\" movie. As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of the cast of \"Xica da Silva\" on one stage, don\\'t.)   Carlos Mencia likes to use the word \"beaners\" as much as Dave Chappelle liked using the \"n\" word. Neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it\\'s from \\'their own people\\'. Carols Mencia also likes to say, \"If you\\'re offended, too bad\". It\\'s not the offense, it\\'s the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.  Carols Mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. It\\'s not comedy, it\\'s not funny. There is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.  Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. Until then, the show, Mind of Mencia is a pass.',\n",
       " b'I finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity, since I had read so many people praising it to the skies, particularly Angela Lansbury\\'s portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me.  To begin with, the casting. George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to Johnny Depp\\'s unending wooden face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is, quite simply, annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter\\'s piping and expressionless little girl\\'s voice, but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a \"look, Ma, I\\'m acting!\" fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions, heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)...  Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Did anybody besides me notice that she can\\'t sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn\\'s daughter is just creepy, considering that she was married to him at the time. Isn\\'t she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Yes, I realize that this is what acting is all about, but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase \"mutton dressed as lamb\" seems to have been coined just for her. Her butchering of \"Green Finch And Linnet Bird\" had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton\\'s movie, and this was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960\\'s and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead, and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director\\'s hands.  Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn, which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner\\'s Ring cycle where, due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the \"juvenile\" leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal\\'s Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn\\'s Johanna...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can\\'t understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there\\'s more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that, I\\'ll go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for the production and aren\\'t constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.  Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do, and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production.',\n",
       " b\"Clich\\xc3\\xa9-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story \\xc2\\x96 Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona \\xc2\\x96 you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure. So what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. In place of a conventionally happy ending, there is a regrettably portentous finale about `Identity' \\xc2\\x96 Xavier has \\xc2\\x91become' all the friends he made. Nevertheless, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro-audience, who enjoyed themselves hugely and even applauded at the end.\",\n",
       " b'What a despairing film. Dress actors in furry rags, place in suburban wasteland, set cameras rolling and hope for the best. One can only imagine e the thanks the cast gave when their characters were killed off by sockpuppets, thus sparing them further humiliation in this dullfest. This rivals Monster a go-go as the best cure for insomnia ever made. Oh God - how can I fill up 10 lines explaining how overwhelmingly bored everybody looks in this movie? Whiney crappy plastic bungling robot who annoys everybody both on and off screen, Giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by string, actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while mumbling off dialogs...',\n",
       " b\"I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore on the 2005 Rotterdam Filmfestival, It was the first of ten films I saw there.  Le Conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the visuals, complementing the colorful and stylish architecture-like images.  Toni Servillo plays the main character in the film, Titta. He's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. Every week, he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this.  He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; Looks calculated and well-dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him. For example Sofia (played very nicely by Olivia Magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she's been working in the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she does greet him. On one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar, instead of his usual spot at a window. From here the story really begins, and will unfold in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and the mafia.  I won't spoil the rest of the film. See this film if you love stylish movies like ones from David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Don't see this if you're an action-buff.\",\n",
       " b\"I bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. I thought that with the cast present in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe & Mario Van Peebles are all OK), it would be pretty good. Boy, was I wrong. This movie annoyed the hell out of me. Almost every scene drags on too long. The scene where Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie. The rest is no picknick either. My guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.  Conclusion: The current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!  If you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'Mean Guns'(with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.\",\n",
       " b\"I watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I didn't know what to expect precisely, and for the first ten minutes I feared I might not enjoy this film. It was beginning very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read.  But I definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it. It is one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing.  Seldom have I seen actors play so wonderfully, with such an intensity on their faces : Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and Sydow is excellent too.  There is always psychological violence in Bergman movies, and this one may be the most physically violent of them all. The strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them...  Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. An excellent Bergman.  \",\n",
       " b\"This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.  Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie. It is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the TV.  Only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity.\",\n",

She decides to try it out, but begins to make a boyfriend of her own, her dreamdate. Then suddenly there is an explosion in a gas pipe and her creation comes to life.

       " b'Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie \"Paul Renauld\" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld.(Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie has \"combined\" two persons into one! \"Cinderella\" has been removed by the movie. The girl Hastings falls in love with and the ex-girlfriend of Jack Renauld are one person in the movie! Why for god\\'s sake? 3)Hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player. Totally unfunny and stupid. 4) The movie tells secrets much too early (for example at the very beginning). So you know things you shouldn\\'t know. 5) The murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn\\'t exists in the book. Perhaps because the person (\"cinderella\") who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie. 6)The book is very complex. The movie takes only about 90 minutes. Sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning (e.g. bicycle race).',\n",
       " b'Even from the very commencing title of this movie I really love the artwork and canvas layout of one of the national islands of Japan. We see some great rolling green hills and some oriental houses of a coastal town. Instantly we are looking at the Pacific beauty on the widescreen of the theater. And to prove how great this film is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolution classes and school sciences such as biology would fantastically favor Hayao Miyazaki\\'s brand new movie entitled \"Ponyo\". The title character, as you will see, may be the perfect animation icon of media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums alike.  Besides the scientific aspect of all this, let\\'s dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a skinny, old and powerful sorcerer named Fujimoto who lives in a submersible and is cynical of the urban expansion of mankind and their pollution of industrial waste. He wants to have complete control of the seas and the cute looking peaceful aquatic life including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is composed to be half-human and half-amphibious, resembles both an ocean loving anti-hero and antagonist; similar to the James Bond villain Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me who operates an Atlantis-dubbed underwater city.   His daughter, whom he treats like an over-cared-for pet, is named Ponyo. She is a large goldfish who already looks like a pretty red-haired girl. The father bans her from the real human world, claiming it to be dangerous and too much for her to handle. But quite frankly, Ponyo\\'s exploratory curiosity is as strong as her amorous nature. Eventually with building strength, similar to wonderful scenes from Nick Park\\'s \"Chicken Run\", she breaks free of her father\\'s rocky and fossilized aquatic city and swims to the water surface of Japan, and to her luck and joy, falls into the caring hands of a youngster ship tanker captain named Sosuke.   Living in an ocean front house at a neat looking beach (or boulder filled beach), Sosuke has two overworking parents, a senior home working mother Lisa and the first mate of a tanker barge Koichi. Lisa seems to be angry at her spouse for being away on a ship and leaving her with all the housework. Even more so, the black magic that is exerted by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur: the moon approaches the Earth too closely and waves surge from the unbalancing of the tidal interaction forces, and humongous tsunami waves rack the peaceful but evacuated town. However what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than supernatural might is the love and tightly embraced friendship between the childish Captain Sosuke and the adorable red-headed Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive human than just a preserved fish. Much like the frizzly haired and free-spirited hobbits in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo grants me a slight reminder of that.  I could write on and on about this amazing animated film, the best since \"Coraline\" which was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, feast your eyes on another 10 star grade from your animation fan, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 may be filled with dozens of animated films; however, Ponyo is the most towering film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.',\n",
       " b\"Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the very worst movie I've seen all year, and I've run across some doozies. There is nothing redeeming about this trash, from the characterization to the direction to the plot. Even the usually brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't save this movie. None of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this dismal failure).  *******Possible Spoilers********  The main problem with Tart is that it rambles on without saying anything. It staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story. It also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother's possessions constantly being repossessed, the anti-semitic classmate, the other classmate's murderous father) without successfully exploring a single one of them. And just when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end.  I left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film from a writer/director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public.  I gave this film 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad films.\",\n",
       " b'I saw this film at our crossroads film festival, and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black. I was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they endeavored to portray. How did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two were f***ing the girl under the tree? It was unclear. And, There seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents, and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., despite the awful, \"this must be how they sound, just soften the \"r\"\" approach to dialogue, so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether. Aleksa especially sounded like a new york street tough during \"emotional\" scenes, and nobody sounded mississippian at all. Walt Goggins\\' character was supposed to have been from Morgan city, Louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city\\'s blend of new orleans and cajun accents. The other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him. Before I start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia, I\\'ve enjoyed many films with gay love themes, notably \"punks\" \"when love comes\" and \"b monkey\". But this seemed to be some man\\'s wish about all young men. Well, Tennessee williams has already covered this ground, and did a far better job of it. So, I wonder, if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in Minnesota and in Mississippi, why can\\'t anyone else? What a waste of my time.',\n",
       " b\"Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the tale of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for covert support of the Mujaheddin in 1980s Afghanistan following the USSR invasion of the country. This conflict played a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR.  In terms of film making, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It well-written, well-acted, and well-shot. While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for yet another fine performance, I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that Congressman Wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.  There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. The first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they did suffer large civilian casualties, the Mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of Afghanistan. This government, ignored entirely in the film, not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the Soviet Union for support in their effort. The film also ignores that the US was aiding the Mujaheddin prior to the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Those complaints notwithstanding, I did enjoy watching Charlie Wilson's War and do recommend it. I would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson's War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana.\",\n",
       " b'It would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it - as I did - but this is well worth a look. If you think about it, its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject. Casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends credence to his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. Vosloo plays it very sensitively involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that befall himself and his wife. Special Effects are used sparingly but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. Also, after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down. The supporting characters were unnecessarily weak (the alien hunter) or menacing (the psychiatrist) which also served to detract.  But all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line \"How do think animals feel when we experiment on them\".  The concept of \"lost time\" was also thought provoking.',\n",
       " b'Having been a Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting Marine Corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film centers on one recruit who doesn\\'t seem to \"get with the program.\" A more recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.',\n",
       " b'The magnitude of the Stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie: \"In the battle of Stalingrad, more than one million people were killed in action, froze to death or died of starvation: Russians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Germans, Austrians. Of the 260,000 surrounded men of the Sixth Army, 91,00o were taken prisoners, of whom only 6,000 returned to their homeland, years later.  What the story does not tell was that Fieldmarshall Paulus, who surrendered, did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men. He had a special treatment as the highest ranking prisonner taken by the Soviet army. When, during his presence at the Nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the 91,000 prisoners, he declared that they were fine. He was freed after the war and died in the East Germany.  The film only presents the first part of the tragedy, the actual battle of Stalingrad. However, for an entire picture, the fate of the 91,000 prisonners should also not be forgotten.',\n",
       " b\"Thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. Thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. It works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller. There is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. The pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when Casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, Nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. Thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...  The first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. The scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike. It's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke back him up nicely. This film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances; Thursday is likely to suffice.\",\n",
       " b'The Plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus, and October)are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to divide up their late friend\\'s belongings. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides there\\'s no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol\\' Loomis.  The Production: This film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood craze of low-budget PG-13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. The direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. The dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die.  The idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. But the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud.  If you\\'ve ever got a craving for a \"killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life\" horror film take my advice and skip Stay Alive for the superior Brainscan.',\n",
       " b'This is yet another pseudo-intellectual \"let\\'s make the Nazis look real bad\" movie. The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt - most of already know that. However, that does not necessarily make every movie on the theme good. A Discovery Channel presentation of \"The Wannsee Conference\" would have been much more interesting.   \"Conspiracy\" falls on its ass between two categories: documentary and drama. It doesn\\'t cut it as a documentary, the movie is too `staged\\' and the presentation too `common\\'. It doesn\\'t cut it as a drama, the characters are too shallow and conflicts too easily `solved\\'.  Another thing is the tagline: \"One Of The Greatest Crimes Against Humanity Was Perpetrated In Just Over An Hour.\" As the movie shows the Wannsee Conference the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. The decision on the solution had already been taken by the SS. The sole purpose of the meeting was to make all significant stakeholders commit themselves to an already established plan. There were no decisions or plans made at the Wannsee Conference. There was only threats and coercion (some needed less than others).  Finally: One thing the movie does show (although in no exceptional manner) is, man has a tendency to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to hide for himself the fact that he is committing appalling atrocities. This is seen in most powermongering `leaders\\' and politicians.',\n",
       " b\"I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.  But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago. I think the innocence of the charactors, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period of time, left a long term imprint for reasons I don't quite understand. Maybe it is because I was a teenager at the time I saw it, and it touched me somehow..... I really don't know! I also REALLY wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened. Oh, the agony!!  I've not seen it before, or since, but I would love to. I keep a casual look out for it, but I now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I'd proberbly miss it in the TV guide even if it DID show up. Pssttt!!!  Reading the reviews here has renewed my interest. If anyone knows of its availability in Australia, by all means email me and let me know.  Oh, and Sean Bury... nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here. I've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond film. What are you up to these day? Oh, and do YOU have a copy of the film? CHEERS!!!\",\n",
       " b\"Just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine, and yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. While he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell.  The movie shows us where our world is going to, what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big, personal and global, character and formula.  The real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves.  It takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing, but it's worth it.  Highly recommended.\",\n",
       " b\"trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this film falls down in two of these. It does indeed take place in space - but it is neither funny or scary. The plot is dismal and the one joke, concerning the computer's intellect, is overplayed to death. Saying that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The homo-esque relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable. All in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv, preferably whilst do the ironing.\",\n",
       " b\"The bad news: the Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar released by Maple Pictures that I saw was of poor quality. Dark and washed out, it appeared to be dubbed haphazardly from a VHS tape. It even skips at one point due to some missing frames.  The good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the DVD detracted little from my viewing enjoyment. This horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares. It is a horrorless horror film. While most frightening films have limited dialog, Beast In The Cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters. Presumably, all the chit chat acts as filler for a very low budget, unimaginative movie. Unfortunately, the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch.\",\n",
       " b\"This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other portrayed characters have lawyers suing the hell out of VH1 for there portrayal. The acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary. Its supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy to me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. I usually like Flex Alexanders acting but this time he has completely missed the mark.  You could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself, because it was so horrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE. But if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing, Tune in. Other than that, don't waste your time.\",\n",
       " b'This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn\\'t want to move to this location is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the \"author\" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too. Although it was unsuccessful, the film is great as it is both short and sweet and well as very romantic. 10/10',\n",
       " b\"I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like it. It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched. I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.\",\n",
       " b'I saw \\'Begotten\\' last night, and I\\'m of two minds on the film.  On one hand, I appreciate it for being the total invert of a Michael Bay film. No dialogue, extremely stylized grainy B&W photography, some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film, and a very compelling use of sound (which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet). It\\'s a reflection on a theme, and it dares go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. It\\'s a movie that most people don\\'t understand, and if you read through these comments you\\'ll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them shrieking about \\'pretentiousness\\' with the fervor of a gibbon rattling the bars of its cage at feeding time. It genuinely shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago.  On the other, this is a thirty-minute short that sprawls out to over an hour and a half. I understand that there might be artistic merit in using repetition and monolithic pacing as a bludgeon, but in this case it just doesn\\'t help everything hang together. Imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who grabys you by the shoulders and says something that completely confounds the core of your being... but then, instead of leaving your shattered and gibbering in his wake, he just keeps talking and talking and talking. By the end of the movie, I found myself glancing at my watch now and again.   This is not entertainment, people. This is disentertainment. This is how you deprogram people who just watched \"Glitter.\" If you watch movies to be entertained, this will frustrate, confound, and possibly anger you. You don\\'t approach \\'Begotten\\' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before, something you see furtive glances of through the kitchen door, something that\\'s dark and glistens and twitches on its platter; something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just have to know what it\\'s like.',\n",
       " b'I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I wondered to myself, \"Why have I never heard of this movie?\" Then I turned over the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself.   First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters. This is the worst role I\\'ve ever seen Chazz Palminteri play and I\\'m surprised he would do something this ridiculous. However, under-appreciated yet talented actors must earn their money. Palminteri plays a one dimensional police detective who comes off about as dumb as a C-movie mob henchman. Him, along with the lead detective (the poorly directed Nolte), the great but simple Michael Madsen, and the late Chris Penn (whose role along with Madsen\\'s was completely thrown away) make up an elite squad of LA detectives tasked to rid the city of mobsters sometime in the late 30s or 40s. The movie introduces this squad as cops who will break every law to make sure those who think they\\'re above the law don\\'t operate in their city. At the beginning of the film the cops rough up a local restaurant, grab an alleged mobster (William Peterson) and take him to a place they call the Mulholland Falls. They toss him off one of the cliffs on Mullholland Drive and this is supposed to demonstrate how serious these guys are about ridding the city of crime. Whatever. This was nothing more than a cheap excuse to use a crappy title that\\'s designed to make you think of LA and its famous sites. Somewhere later on they find the dead body of Jennifer Connelly and the plot begins.   On to the direction which was nothing short of amateur and WEAK! Aside from the fact that the characters were B-movie quality, the overacting by those such as Treat Williams, the guy who plays the chief of police, and the awful Daniel Baldwin are just a few highlights that made this movie seem like it was Lee Tamhori\\'s first film. There\\'s not one good performance in the movie aside from maybe Melanie Griffith, who some might argue was the worst in the movie (she won a Razzie for this film). In the end, it was her character that was not that great and she really didn\\'t have much to work with.   As with any bad movie, it all begins with the writing, and this script was no gem. Plot is formulated simply on the basis of setting up the next scene and never takes into consideration characters\\' motivations. The way the characters behaved was unbelievable. Cops taking the law into their own hands is believable within the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL) but in this case it looked like these guys could get away with anything, including murder, and never bat an eye about cleaning anything up. I guess we as an audience are just supposed to assume that no one saw anything and that people won\\'t ask questions. Everything about the story is predictable and is spoon fed so well that we understand everything that\\'s going to happen a good while before the characters do. However, it doesn\\'t make us feel smart, but rather makes us angry at how stupid the hero is, despite the fact that there aren\\'t any heroes in this movie.   In the end, the best component of the movie was the great score by David Grusin. From the beginning, it invoked a since of CHINATOWN, which quickly faded when I realized how unbelievable just about everything in the film was. It didn\\'t surprise me to learn that it made a whopping eleven million in the box office. What I will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs. Nick Nolte\\'s acting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard dog and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also nearly fell on the floor at each of the slow motion shots used in the film (I think there are three with one during a key fight scene). When you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you clearly have some problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I will recommend this movie solely for the purpose of enticing laughter, that is, if you appreciate the good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.',\n",
       " b\"This fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points, it's badly made, has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic premise.  This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. I'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to Italy (only for suspension of disbelieve) but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exist is total nonsense.  First of all, Lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he wasn't, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources.  So we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror.  After seeing the film Frankenstein Lovecraft said that he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt that her work was butchered. I feel sorry for Lovecraft.\",\n",
       " b'I can\\'t say what knowing the source for this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite films from Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a retake on the Shakespeare \"comedy\", but utterly removed from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and star Cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to re-center himself, Cassavettes retreats to a remote Greek island--where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. With Raul Julia especially, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. And funny. It wasn\\'t a big box office hit, but whenever it does come to DVD, it will sell.',\n",
       " b'I appear to be in the minority, but I thought \"Radio\" was pretty awful. It seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of \"heartwarming\" movies.  The motivation for the characters falling in love with Radio was never really explained. We were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of Radio except for a couple of bad apples.  You could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away. When the movie wanted you to go \"Awww\" or pull out your tissue, I was rolling my eyes and wished I was watching \"Rudy\" instead.  There were some good performances by the cast. Too bad they weren\\'t given a better movie in wish to appear.',\n",
       " b\"This is the most human and humane of movies that I have seen in a long time. The ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a movie that doesn't preach but neither does it condemn. It is cinema verite at it's best, and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events.  Which of the two is more amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent.  You may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.  At the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect. That is what great drama does, it gives catharsis, it creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.\",\n",

This was another movie of watching the Olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some cute guys,look pretty and have everyone drooling over them.the direction,the plot development,ugh the acting. i don't know about the U.S., but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to hop onto the bike of a guy u met like,10 minutes back. though i'm now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, i really hope that one day we'll get to watch a movie with an original,even slightly plausible plot.\",\n",

       " b'The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it\\'s not even close to being historically accurate either. It\\'s just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff. A real shame.  To begin with, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality TV show. Seriously. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they REALLY feel about what\\'s happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not the church kind, the Real World kind) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about. She looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s. It\\'s \"The Real World: Tudor England!\"   Jodhi May is a very good actress and after \\'The Aristocrats\\' and \\'A Turn of the Screw\\' I was becoming a real fan of hers. But she should never have been cast as Anne. Actually I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a poor choice. She\\'s a good actress, sure, but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was \"that girl\" from \\'The Truman Show.\\' She was.) She\\'s also too old to play the teen-aged Mary so for some unknown reason they made Mary the oldest of the sisters. It makes no sense, I know. It\\'s like the BBC seemed to forget that these people actually lived. They\\'re twisting the story around and making things up left and right. I feel ridiculous having to correct the BBC on historical inaccuracies, but REALLY!   Apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for George, and his casting was the real reason I decided to seek out this movie. Big mistake. He does a great job, sure, but he\\'s hardly in this. How can anyone pretend they\\'re adapting The Other Boleyn Girl and hardly mention George Boleyn? That\\'s just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but yet again, was hardly in the finished product.   The real problem with this is the script. There\\'s just no getting around that. It\\'s bad. It\\'s really, really bad. It\\'s too melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is portrayed as an air-head, Mary as the ringleader, and George as the follower. Mary\\'s first husband is hardly mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they simply do not tell the story Phillippa Gregory wrote. The whole thing comes across as a great big waste. I have no desire to see this thing a second time. I guess I\\'ll just have to read the book again and hope that the Natalie Portman version due out next year will be much better.  *Note: As of this writing, the only way of obtaining this miniseries in the USA is on the last disc of the miniseries \\'The Six Wives of Henry VIII.\\' That\\'s a great miniseries but can cost $50 to $60 and that\\'s way to much to spend if you\\'re just looking for this piece of garbage.',\n",
       " b\"I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't. They're trying too hard to be different, and tying to force the humor. That style usually doesn't work too well. I don't think this show finishes the season. Of course, I could be wrong.\",\n",
       " b\"Eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service. They soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath (Kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. It doesn't help that the guard watching over them (Steven Vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier.   A guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. Most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mixture between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well. It was really just a bunch of clich\\xc3\\xa9s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills.   The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. A second rate Jason Voorhees, if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers.   While the death scenes are gory, they aren't necessary scary. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. Because of this, the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. Also, if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching. Rating 6/10\",\n",
       " b'You know that this film is in SERIOUS trouble when the BEST acting job is the support role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. While this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn\\'t the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he\\'s Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of this being her \"break out film\", this and a Beverly Hills Cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. It was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from Arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.',\n",
       " b'Let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original \"Lonesome Dove\" than I. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing works. There is no comparison between \"Lonesome Dove\" and any Western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series, what with McMurtry\\'s non-participation, and the missing original cast members. After watching the first episode it was clear that this is no \"Lonesome Dove\". In almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. But so what? I wasn\\'t expecting it to measure up. Taken as an effort of it\\'s own this film is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. If it were done as a new story, not as a sequel to \"Lonesome Dove\", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a creditable job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a terrific Clara, and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and believable. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler Isom Pickett. The film made me care about the characters, and I don\\'t ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it\\'s predecessor- it is worth viewing in it\\'s own right.',\n",
       " b'As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The \"creature feature\" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), but this movie makes me think the creators weren\\'t even trying. It might be worth checking out just for the \"make fun of me\" potential (count the gunshots!), but I couldn\\'t in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.',\n",
       " b'**SPOILERS** Looking for a little more excitement then seeing crocodiles being fed at the local game reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, together with Grace\\'s boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, decide to take a trip upstream in the desolate and deserted, of human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps.  With their swamp guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat the four get upended by a giant saltwater crocodile who quickly grabs and drags a terrified Jimmy down to the bottom along with him. Grace Pat & Adam end up stranded on a tree in the swamp with Pat hanging on for dear life on the capsized boat. The rest of the film has the hungry and determined crocodile play a cat and mouse, or crock\\' and human, game with the trio that ends in a showdown at a mud bank just where the dead and dismembered body of jimmy finally came to it\\'s rest.  Both the director and actors in the film take full advantage of the swamp making it at times far more scary then the giant crocodile swimming in it. We get to see the killer crocodile just about a half dozen times in the movie but everyone of them hits you, and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam, right in the gut.  Alway there were kept in suspense by the giant reptile always doing his damage from beneath that comes so unexpectedly that it, the crock attacks, has far more effect when you don\\'t see them coming then, like in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do. You wonder right from the start who in the end would survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell about them. The ending with the crocodile vrs human confrontation was about the weakest and most unrealistic part in the film.   The crocodile who was both so cagey and effective in the earlier scenes seemed to have punched, or swam, himself out not having either the strength or speed to grab, with his deadly jaws, and finish off the sole survivor of the expedition. In fact the killer crock was so ineffective that even after he gabbed his victim, or victims, he just couldn\\'t hold on to them. This in the end turned out to be fatal on his part.  A lot like \"Jaws\" the film \"Black Water\" has the killer crocodile, like the great White Shark in \"Jaws\", more interested is killing his human prey then eating them. With all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited the crocodile was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, for invading his watery domain that he felt was the grand ruler of. And for daring to do that they were to pay with their lives!',\n",
       " b\"I have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since I've seen it.  Don't get me wrong - I have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between Kidman and Law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. I cried for about two hours straight after wards.   It had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad I watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own.   The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least).   I recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield.\",\n",
       " b'For those of you who have a few kind words for this film, I suspect you didn\\'t see it when it was released as \"Parts: The Clonus Horror.\"   It was a dreadfully boring movie. It missed the mark in at least three ways. It wasn\\'t good enough to be scary; it wasn\\'t bad enough to be funny (although MST3K took care of that); and, even in 1979, the plot was unoriginal.  Earlier contenders are \"The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler\" (1971). It\\'s the same idea (clones as spare parts). The movie is entertaining, and it had a fine cast. Another is \"Sleeper\" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flattened nose? And \"Clones\" (1973). The last two plots aren\\'t as similar to Clonus as the first one, but they predate Clonus.  They are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea, although often, the word \"clone\" isn\\'t used.',\n",

There isn't a Screenplay, It's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.\",\n",
       " b'I am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie. In the case of Comanche Moon I was so uninspired I felt the need to warn others how bad this TV mini series is. Here are a few thoughts.  The Indians: They came across like they were in a Saturday Night Live Skit, making fun of how Indians talk. When McMurtry writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting; I am not sure how they ended up with what they got.  Gus McCrae: Looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke Series. Acting is OK and the mannerisms from Robert Duvall\\'s McCrae are right on, but the look is pure comedy cowboy.  Clara: Maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time. Ever been in Austin in the summer before Air conditioning? I promise you women did not look like that. Do you think they never saw any episodes of Dearwood?  Gov. Elisha Pease: Again whenever they are in the Governor\\'s office it feels like a Saturday Night Live Skit, and the skit is bombing.  Woodrow Call: Call is the most reasonable character, of course He talks so little how can you screw up that? But hey, what about that hat?  Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that he isn\\'t even a tiny bit scary. They should have gotten Javier Bardem to play the part.  The Rangers: Right out of \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\" I expected George Cloony to come riding up and them to break into a song.  Perhaps I am premature because the miniseries isn\\'t completed but I doubt I will watch any more of it any way.  I would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of Lonesome Dove, but I watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all.',\n",
       " b\"I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I found it to be very enjoyable. Heath Ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details but things go very bad for Ledger and gets into big trouble with Bryan Brown. From their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving Ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. And lets not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.\",\n",

I enjoyed every bit of this movie...and that\\'s pretty rare! I highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is one film you don\\'t want to miss!!! :D  By the way...if you\\'re a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies, BRING TISSUES!!!

       " b\"With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Department S will be forever associated with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King.  Most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of Austin Powers but that will do a disservice to the character: He's far more nuanced than that.  Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end), he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not), a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever Annabelle is right...and she often is. He's clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives but.......Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero, it wouldn't have worked but he shows King often as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love of finery and prone to grandstanding (and it gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in TV history. And by not playing him as whiter-than-white, the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it.  Watching it again on DVD recently, you get to see just how much depth Wyngarde put into Jason King.\",\n",
       " b'This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen.  Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too memorable.  Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here.   The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive.   NOT destined to be a great one to remember.',\n",

Oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television. Tom Fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is evidence of just how good TV can be. It follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your everyman Tobias Beecher, in jail for vehicular manslaughter. We see what we don't want to see, pain, death, mayhem. Oz will disturb you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it will make you think. To see Oz is to see a truly magnificent television production\",\n",
       " b'I saw Anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the 2003 sequel and as I watch a lot of foreign films in various genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. Not only is it annoying to know the voices don\\'t belong to the actors, but they always seem cheerful, like the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. It makes an otherwise awesome movie seem horrible and I have had to convert a lot of my friends who used to think foreign films aren\\'t as good as North American films - that they aren\\'t \"Hollywood enough\". Also, they translation is never right, it\\'s too literal, and screws up the vibe of the movie, even if it\\'s basically saying the same thing. I watched Anatomy by myself the other week in German then with subtitles with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn\\'t want to have to miss parts when he couldn\\'t see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 mins in and he begged me to let him finish his work then start the movie over with subtitles. He loved it! Both movies are awesome as intellectual horror films! Kelly',\n",
       " b'Alter Egos do not come funnier than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s Ali G. Completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the Middle England Suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. He persists on living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he keeps tight control of his Posse, the West Staines \"Massiv\".  Spending his spare time between Me Julie, his girl, the Posse and teaching local eight year old Scouts at \"Keep it Real (advanced)\" lessons at the Government funded John Nike Leisure Centre.  This is where the story takes off, being told that the Government funding has stopped, Ali G then proceeds on a one-man quest \"In the struggle for Justice I iz willing to lay down me Life, just like Martin Luther Van Dross did\". Being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.  Charles Dance here plays David Carlton, the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minster, who is \"Even more eviller than Skeletor\". Using Ali G, unknowingly, to lose the Prime Minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the General Election. Seeing Ali G as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. Ali G suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the Prime Minster. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.  Ali G Indahouse is a great British movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the P.M. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is Ali G.  Ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a World that really is real, and who are continually preaching \"Keep it Real\" from their own little World that is the West Staines \"Massiv\" is true comic paradox.  Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the Smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few.  Very Real and very funny.',\n",

She\\'s so pretty and so young\\xc2\\x85 it almost overcomes this major flaw.

The plot line has Santa, feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him any more, taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother. It includes a con-man in a Santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by \"Isaac\" from The Love Boat), the world\\'s largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on Christmas eve, and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of Santa\\'s skis trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it\\'s worse on the little screen. If you see this movie coming up next, run, do not walk, to your television and unplug it. You may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection.

A really remarkably well built tension mounts.   It is deep and horrifying. It goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind.  The plot also has some very surprising shifts.

There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies. The fight scenes were comical and made me feel like I could kick all their $%#@#$. The sound was horrible, as if all sound was recorded on the set.

       " b'After his earlier movie \"Videodrome\", which definitely shows similarities to this movie, director David Cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. It\\'s virtual reality taken to a whole other level.  \"eXistenZ\" is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written. The movie features a fascination and well thought out concept, which gets greatly executed by director David Cronenberg.  \"eXistenZ\" is a movie that knows to constantly fool you. Just when you thought you figured things out, another surprise awaits around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored. You just never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more.  The movie has a perfect kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. They have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is.  The movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever going over-the-top with either one. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn\\'t always that simple to follow because of its events, dialogs and unusual environments.  The movie is not only just weird though. I was actually surprised to see that \"Videodrome\" has an higher rating on here, thought it\\'s a far more inaccessible and \\'odd\\' movie. The movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace. It doesn\\'t ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don\\'t watch this sort of movies.  The movie is good looking, with subtle effective special effects a great visual look, that also provides the movie with a certain required \\'gaming\\' feeling.  The movie is well cast, with Jude Law in a role you don\\'t too often see him in, that of a shy insecure person. It once more shows how actually versatile Law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh also was a great female lead. She hasn\\'t really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star. The movie also features some other well known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe.  An highly original movie that is well worth watching, especially if you have seen \"Videodrome\" previously.  8/10',\n",

I doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has. If you have not seen the 19546 version, you might like this one but, I seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one. This has some nifty special effects but that is not what I look for when telling a movie like the Ten Commandments.

COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere.

Also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough.

No point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers.   It takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. Any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. Since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies, there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways, to get you to laugh hysterically. It doesn\\'t work.  That\\'s not comedy. However, the same old worn out sophomoric \"jokes\" ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. If that\\'s not enough, there\\'s a running \"gag\" of a bus running somebody over. So funny, right? Also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfunny results. A musical bit flops miserably.

Watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. Probably a lot funnier, too.',\n",
       " b\"Another tiresome bore from Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes.  The story centers on Inman (a somnambulent Jude Law), who goes off to the Civil War having just barely started a sort-of romance with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town. The story cuts back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL!!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations back at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back into shape after Kidman's saintly Daddy dies of Inconvenient Character Disease. Zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that Granny Clampett kind of way, dispensing enough Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of Touched By An Angel.  This film is, quite simply, excruciating. Avoid it like the big bloated Oscar-bait Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation nonsense that it is.\",\n",
       " b'Okay, I sensed that a film by Mormons, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did I know how so very painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The Church\\'s official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film \"Cipher in the Snow\" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70\\'s. Then there\\'s Neil LaBute\\'s disturbingly masterful ouvre....  However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn\\'t focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. \"God\\'s Army\" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. While this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted Mormon, director Richard Ductcher\\'s ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge \"God\\'s Army\" unwatchable by almost any standard.  Dutcher\\'s own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you\\'re ever likely to meet. Of course the cast\\'s sorry performances aren\\'t helped any by Dutcher\\'s pathetic script. He should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. It should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the Church\\'s darker side are addressed with little other than faith. At one point an African-American missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep South had already done so). Instead of addressing the Church\\'s actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in Mormon theology which even Church leaders don\\'t defend anymore, Dutcher\\'s troubled character instead ponders Joseph Smith\\'s murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.  If you knew little about Mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.',\n",

There\\'re several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. He\\'s just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.  I think this movie is just an extended version of \"Hitch\", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.  If this is the best movie that this couple has ever made, then I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m not interested in any of his previous ones.',\n",
       " b\"I've seen this movie twice on Transilvania International Film Festival(TIFF), the movie is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best image award).   As a silent cinema fan I'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yester-year cinema. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the movie references directly Lang's Metropolis, and the allegorical-parabolic character of his plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. There's a more obvious Melies-homage though: the Moon with a (here cigar-smoking) human face, and the paper-made, painted mountains and city-landscapes. I enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals, and in the meantime I found very interesting the story on muteness, and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city. From this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the muteness of the silent cinema, because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters. In this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or there's an intention to play upon the muteness of the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflexion I found in Guy Maddin's Careful,where the inhabitants of a mountain-village have restrictions in using their voices. I intend to write a paper on it, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know!!!   I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to every moviegoer (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival).  PS: Winners were announced, and the film won the award for best cinematography!\",\n",
       " b'What is wrong with CURACAO ( Also known as DEADLY CURRENTS though what the reasonn for the name change is I have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :  \" Keep it down baby , I\\'m trying to sleep \"   It\\'s not the dialogue that\\'s the problem or the way it\\'s delivered , it\\'s the fact the actress has has a Central European accent . Nothing wrong with that until it\\'s revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States ! This what struck me about this thriller while watching it - The way accents don\\'t match their characters . Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent we see a South African with an English accent , a local police chief who sounds like he\\'s an Irishman impersonating a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott playing someone who\\'s either Dutch or British with an accent that sounds like it might be American tinged with South African . You soon give up following what\\'s on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . It\\'s interesting to note that this site hasn\\'t given this movie a country of origin . With so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the United Nations   Even if you\\'re not curious about accents or dialects you\\'ll probably have to give up following the action anyway because CURACAO is plot less . Things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for South African intelligence but you\\'re left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to . I was lost',\n",
       " b\"This is a profound and moving work about the creation of art, that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what in the end constitutes family, i.e, all of us. I was very much moved by the family discussion that Nathaniel had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to radiate warmth that Lou had created. And although Esther seems so cold in her discussion about Lou's inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter-weight to his impulses. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all of the people in Lou's life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius. Yes even, or maybe especially, our failures make us who we are. And of course there are the buildings. I had only known Lou Kahn by name and did not really connect his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. Perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit, and it will certainly resemble a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in Jerusalem. Perhaps there is salvation\",\n",
       " b\"Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was only half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton we had only Batman and The Joker both played wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast Batman movie (yes even better then Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have Danny DeVito who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. I feel this way about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy Selena Kyle and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman Max Schreck played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.  Story wise I have to say that Batman Returns has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.  Cinematography was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns.  So all in I truly feel that of all the Batman movies Batman Returns believe it or not tops the Dark Knight for me because while I enjoyed that movie for Heath Ledger's amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the Batman to light the Bat signal for.\",\n",
       " b'Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary.   It\\'s as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says \"Isn\\'t that clever? Am I not smart? Isn\\'t that biting social commentary?\" And,sadly, the answer is always \"Ummmm...no.\" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Thankfully, it died young. Empire Falls falls flat.',\n",
       " b\"After the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. Yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are'nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as Dean Learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have'nt seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in All a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.\",\n",
       " b'Loki, Norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you\\'ll have to actively search for them.  For the most part, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler, but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father, this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he responded \"Convicted felons,\" apparently forgetting for the moment that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  But just making a bad movie is not a sin, or Hell would be overflowing. What makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. To put things in perspective, the day after we watched Son of the Mask, my son and I watched \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture), and was brought in for $7 million. That\\'s right. Just one-tenth of the amount of money spent on Son of the Mask. This, then is the sin -- to flush good money down the sewer, when it could have been better used in making watchable movies, or feeding starving children, or for that matter, almost any other purpose. The producers should truly be ashamed of themselves.',\n",
       " b'In a year when \"Singin\\' in the Rain\" and \"High Noon\" were released, this overstuffed turkey somehow won the Oscar for Best Picture. Half the film is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both overact, although they are models of restraint compared to the annoying Hutton. Playing a self-centered trapeze artist, Hutton acts like an overzealous high school student in a badly produced school play. Grahame is the only cast member to turn in a decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, only in creating an overlong spectacle, not matter how dull.',\n",
       " b'Shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. He does not know when to stop. When the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. When the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of Konkan\\'s greenery. When the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums... you get the idea.   Not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people\\'s nose hair. There are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13\" TV. Also Amruta Subhash who plays Asavari is the worst actress I\\'ve seen in quite a long time. A normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly.  I give it 4/10 solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. The fact that a movie like Shwaas gets to be India\\'s entry to the Oscars tells volumes not about the state of Indian cinema but the state of Indian judging committees. A movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty.',\n",
       " b'The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason I felt compelled to finish it out! Basically, I wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens, any UFO\\'s, anything at all suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was. This could have been used to the movie\\'s advantage, but I felt, instead, that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! Finally, how big was this cast\\'s wardrobe!? I became so distracted by the number of different, and extremely bright, shirts each character had on in every new scene that I began to wonder if this movie wasn\\'t really supposed to be classified under \"poor comedy\".  toe thumbs down!',\n",
       " b'I\\'ve watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from David Spade), \"Tommy Boy\" has a giant heart. And that\\'s what keeps this movie funny after all these years.  Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. But after his died dies on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge car parts company. So in order to save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company\\'s new brake pads. Along for the ride, though not by choice, is Richard Hayden (David Spade) a former classmate of Tommy\\'s who was Big Tom\\'s right-hand man.  The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real-life best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. It\\'s the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there as when they\\'re making the audience laugh.  Forgive me, but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography (\"The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts,\" for anyone who cares), and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie more special to me. Chris Farley was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Knowing Chris\\'s story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn\\'t make it any less funny.  Farley and Spade are matched with a good on screen cast. Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy\\'s \"new brother,\" and Bo Derek is solid as his step-mother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they\\'re father in son. Big Tom is just as crazy as his son, although he\\'s smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy\\'s love interest, Michelle.  For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. He doesn\\'t belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they\\'re doing and he allows them to do it. But Segal goes a step further. He gives \"Tommy Boy\" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.  Critics didn\\'t like \"Tommy Boy.\" Shame on them. A movie doesn\\'t have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to do muted comedy a la \"The Office\"). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.',\n",
       " b'I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! To me, it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted ending. As if the contents of the movie weren\\'t scary or weird enough, you have the ending. It\\'s a very awesome movie and I\\'m so happy that it\\'s being released on DVD on August 30th.I will not hesitate to get my copy on that day.I don\\'t think the movie received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other movies came out shortly after and was acknowledge, but if it weren\\'t for my brother telling me about the movie, I wouldn\\'t have known. Which stinks because in my opinion it\\'s far better than any \"Scream\", \"I know what you did Last Summer\", or any other horror for that time. So I hope that you are able to see the movie yourself and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror movie junkie, Campfire Tales was like dessert for me!',\n",

Plot summary: Master P plays a drug dealer that looks, talks, and acts more like a live-action cartoon character. That's all the plot I got out of this movie.  Review: I remember back when I was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is only audible when music plays, and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel. Luckily, I didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates.  My rating:1 out of 10  My verdict: Avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease.\",\n",
       " b'In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by Americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous. This ensemble has been behind some other efforts, most recently \"A Mighty Wind\" which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment, but \"Best In Show\" hits on all cylinders. It is superbly cast with some of the best of current US actors, Parker Posey, who exudes energy even when she stands still, Eugene Levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody\\'s doormat, even when he appears to be (or maybe, \\'indomitable doormat\\'). The brilliant stylings of Fred Willard, the understated performances of so many others, which is a characteristic not normally associated with Americans or American actors.

       " b\"Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was depicted in the 1994 movie. I have read Conrad's novel, and I must say, even though I prefer the novel itself, the movie was a great depiction. The set and costume designs brought Conrad's novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow's journey. The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms, voices, and personalities. If you have read the novel, I recommend that you also view this movie. If you have not read the novel, however, the movie may be harder to follow. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotion, and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long. Therefore, if you have not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets, costumes, and acting. Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work however.\",\n",
       " b'This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of \\'in the round\" theater. Which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action. This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer, and I\\'d say they have made a success of that goal.',\n",

I asked my friend, who\\'d seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity.

So far, this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. That must mean the director, director's girlfriend, producer, actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10.  For the rest of you, who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story, avoid this.  This man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10.

       " b\"Clint Howard, brother of more talented Ron, stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people. Striving to be a movie that's of the 'so bad that it's good' variety, this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as 'so bad that it's...well...BAD'. Wheter it's the constant 'shoe ad' cinema, the pillow stuffed 'fat kid', or the sleep inducing 'horror' that soured me on the film, i don't know, all I know is I loathed the film (and this from a guy who has a soft spot for B-horror films). Paul Norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this, his only 'mainstream' film. A wise choice indeed as horrible acting, nonsense storyline, and ludicrous dialog are much MUCH more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing. Funnily enough this turkey has absolutely NO nudity (another reason to steer clear)   My Grade: D-\",\n",
       " b\"MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a glimpse at Howard Kaylan's giddy and vertiginous ride to fame with his 60's Folk-Rock band, The Turtles. The Turtles were kind of a 'second tier' act during the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink, and party with the Titans of Hippie Culture. And, not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. Many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play. This provides my only complaint about the film. Almost from the beginning of the movie, one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. Too often during the film, I felt that I was watching an engaging exhibition of phony wigs and mustaches. But, if you are a fan of the music of The Turtles, or The Swinging 60's, in general-this might be the film for you. And, don't forget to view The Extras. There is a very funny (and informative) bit by band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.\",\n",
       " b'Lucille Ball cannot sing or act or dance. This makes the quality of her performance in MAME all the more dreadful. She\\'s not allowed to do the low-brow slapstick that made her a hit on TV so she has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Ms. Ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. That vacant stare of Ms. Ball is suppose to convince us she is emoting but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur at all. For this reason every scene she\\'s in is flat.  Moreover, when Ms. Ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career. It was stated that she demanded her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as leadership. It is made worse when she is singing in voice-over and she has to \"act the moment\" without words. Whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing Mame.  I understand that Rosalind Russell did the role on stage and in the film AUNTIE MAME. Also, I am aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original 1966 Broadway musical. Neither of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have pulled this off better than Lucille Ball. Why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting.  The only person that gets out unscathed is Bea Arthur. She\\'s big and wonderful, catty and common in all the right amounts. Unfortunately, you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun. But the film never does and you can\\'t. No one besides Bea Arthur appears to be having any fun.  An additional bad review goes to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen, including the Broadway musical this film is based on. None of that skill and expertise is of aid here. The poor editing and storytelling quailty in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber. That glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of Ms. Ball.',\n",

       " b'Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. And that\\'s exactly what this movie happens to deliver.  However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, \"Blade\" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.  Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters? It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, \"Blade\" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.',\n",
       " b'The film begins with a little girl (Rita) seeing her father killed. He apparently was a criminal who squealed on his fellow crooks. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl has grown to adulthood and STILL her father\\'s past haunts her! A bit later, Rita meets a good-for-nothing and dates him. During one of their dates, he\\'s a bit intoxicated AND driving like a total fool. The cops give chase and he speeds away--killing a pedestrian in the meantime. Here comes the Really stupid part. He convinces her to confess to the crime, as he assures her his lawyers can get her off scot-free. Why, oh why, would she agree to this?! Yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison!! And, soon after her conviction, this boyfriend disappears--showing that he\\'s a total heel. What a chump!!! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) informs her about the truth about the boyfriend. Then, he explains, the boyfriend\\'s family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap. Frankly, this does make sense--as they certainly owe it to her--especially since they knew she\\'d go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her aside.  Now the idea of bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea. However, there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it\\'s hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit-and-run! In an interesting twist, the dumb lady decides on a life of crime--donning a wig and picking up a rich guy--taking him into the desert and robbing him at gunpoint! Wow...how she\\'s changed! Apparently she loves the idea of stealing from \"phonies\"--i.e., rich hypocrites. However, and this made no sense, she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriend--why she bothered to do some petty robberies in the meantime made little sense. And, what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk, she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man for mayor. Odd...very, very odd.  In the meantime, another plot develops involving a young Alan Ladd. He\\'s an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob. He was chosen because he just happens to be a dead ringer for a real crook--what a clich\\xc3\\xa9! But what makes no sense is that this real crook isn\\'t in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is infiltrating the mob in another town.  Eventually, evidence that Ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to the mob kingpins--including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, as in the interim, she\\'s made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman, as she\\'s met a really nice guy who she wants to marry! Wow,...what are the odds?! Overall, this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from \"kitchen sink syndrome\"--in other words, there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable. Plus, since the movie is only a little over an hour long, it all seems very forced and contrived. It\\'s a relatively bad B-movie from crap-studio PRC of note only for the performance of Alan Ladd just before he gained great fame the following year at Paramount.  By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video---a company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but which NEVER cleans up the prints or adds closed captions. In other words, the DVD production values are strictly 3rd-rate...at best.',\n",
       " b'One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.  Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.  It\\'s hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND\\'s caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight. At this stage in her career, Olivia was appearing in so many \"nobility\" roles requiring a regal presence but nothing more.  A trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made-for-TV movies of that era.',\n",
       " b'A film that deserved theatrical release. This made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast, writer, director and cinematographer.  This film is definitely one of my all time favorites. While nothing is perfect, this film comes very, very close.  Along with an excellent script, great direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face.  If this comes on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score, and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film. I highly recommend recording it, since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded.',\n",
       " b'This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan... Daly, this show does not seem to have any of these.  I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I am going to stick to it. Though it\\'s too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. I hope that this show will last long!  Returning back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O\\'Brien, for example (I know it\\'s a cardinal sin to be repelled by O\\'Brien\\'s antics; but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness).   I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen\\'s spoof of Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. Idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people\\'s pictures, and (if I am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting \"Gary Coleman\".  Added on 16th April, 2007: Coming back once again, I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was funny as hell.  I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, I would better write down my suggestion here for him: I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of late night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike\\'s talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of SNL, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA).  God willing!  Returning back on 14th July, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike\\'s talkshow must be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.',\n",
       " b'I\\'ll admit that this isn\\'t a great film. It practically screams \"low-budget\" yet oddly I still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy. It was like the Little Engine That Could and a movie merged into one!   The film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their low-level employees--two page boys (one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss) as well as a new receptionist. All three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobs.  Into this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue. I didn\\'t know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise. However, like most B-mysteries, the cops are lamebrains and it\\'s up to our pushy hero (Moran) to try to save the day. Throughout all this, I had a hard time deciding if Moran was obnoxious or endearing. I\\'m still not sure!!   There is a moment in the film that is high on the \\'cringe factor\\' and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians. They show up in black-face and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of Amos n\\' Andy. Apart from being very insensitive, it also wasn\\'t funny. Fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same way.  Overall. it\\'s easy to skip this film and I wouldn\\'t blame you if you do. However, the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and I am glad I saw it. A good film? No. But one that is still worth a peek for fans of old Bs.  By the way, perhaps I just don\\'t have very good taste, but I thought BOTH female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their warblings. Listen for yourself and let me know what you think. I just couldn\\'t believe either was allowed to sing on film--even if it was just for lowly Monogram Studios.',\n",
       " b\"For a movie that was PG, this is one fun film. I grew up on watching this film over and over. Its really fun, I don't know how today audience would react, but if you grew up on it, or loved the 80s, then this is a great film. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, who, I think, is one of the best characters in the film. Paul Ruebens also pops in for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.\",\n",
       " b'FOUR FRIENDS was first billed on HBO in 82 as a sleeper hit. Having heard the term \\'sleeper\\' when 14, back then - I was anxious to see one. (!) Boy - was I surprised! That film! I hadn\\'t really fallen in love with a non-special effects film outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE - much less a \\'hippy flick\\'...but having had grown up with a couple of hippies - I understood the power behind Mr. Penn\\'s film. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of a kind. The script is so personable - and that cast!!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO well! He just personifies the \\'writer type\\' to a tee - both smart and clumsy (the scene at the window...) and strong yet so very vulnerable. For me - he captures what it\\'s like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade...and I have always found solace in the character - and in the film. Throughout the 80\\'s FOUR FRIENDS was a partner in crime to me - and I caught the movie whenever I could on HBO - even if I had to stay up until 5AM! And still, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies \"that girl\" to the hilt - it is so hard not to be charmed by her. This movie really stands the test of time. Every once and a while I check out my video of it...or show a friend...and it STILL gets a solid reaction. I\\'ve known women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels..! Just an incredible little 60\\'s piece of humanity. Very special, very magical. I recently found THE NOVELIZATION of FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach - and it\\'s even more detailed that the movie! Actual dates of events, etc. A real find! And what\\'s more - haha - I found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store...in Omaha, NE of ALL places!!! Guess you have to have an eye for her! When I was in L.A. in 92 working as an extra - I went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop - and there were a TON of stills from the film!!! Unfortunately - I was broke and couldn\\'t indulge...but boy, those photos of Georgia and the guys all together just went right through me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in summer of 92...and we spoke about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Also...working at a video store in Omaha in 98 - waited on a female who was a relative of Jim Metzler..! Told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in Omaha who was just fanatical about the film - and had gotten the utmost out of it. Once again - the movie captures everything that\\'s in Danilo\\'s character\\'s heart...great, great work --- one of mssrs Tesich and Penn\\'s finest efforts. Steve Tesich is sorely missed. An incredible writer. \"Isadora Duncan!!!\"  - C.',\n",

       " b'All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv\\'s diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just don\\'t fly, do it? Why then has it received so much praise? As others have implied, it gets the \"conscience vote\" from the west. Show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we\\'ll applaud in a heartbeat. But--oh--don\\'t forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.  I\\'m terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. All I can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. Cannes Film Festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). To find the real gems, you\\'ll have to work hard at it.',\n",
       " b\"I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000). Here are the low points: The acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and looked cheap, the direction was pathetic, and the CGI visual effects childish.  If you want to watch Dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.\",\n",
       " b'Hilarious film, I had a great time watching it. The star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He has played in lots of tough-guy roles, epic-sword films, and romances. It was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of gloves. If I remember it was also dubbed in English which made things even more funnier. (kinda like seeing John Wayne speak Turkish).',\n",
       " b'Except for the appearance of talented Austin Powers impersonator Richard Halpern, this pic was your run of the mill movie spoof. Dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this endeavor in future. Watch for \"Groovy\" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It\\'s a hoot and a half.  Poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous starlets in skimpy outfits, so at least that should keep one entertained (if that\\'s what thrills you).  For my money, I would rent the DVD of classic spoofs such as \"Airplane\" or \"Lobster Man from Mars\".',\n",
       " b'I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but I honestly can\\'t seem to come up with much. I can\\'t even come up with many of those \"so bad, it\\'s good\" kind of moments. Devil Fish is just plain old bad. The plot is completely derivative (Jaws, anyone?), the acting is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond bad, and the score is annoying. Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you\\'ve got one stinker of a movie. I think, however, that the film\\'s biggest sin is its lack of a budget. It doesn\\'t appear that Bava had much to work with. By 1984, the Italian film industry was in full decline \\xc2\\x96 especially as far as genre films go. The funding available to Bava was most probably very meager. Film\\'s like Devil Fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good. It\\'s not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. There are a number of Italian movies made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations.   However, having said all that and noting the film\\'s many weaknesses, I can\\'t bring myself to rate Devil Fish lower than a 3/10. I\\'ve even considered rating it higher but can\\'t because I realize how bad a movie it is. Why don\\'t I rate it lower? Well that\\'s hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, there\\'s something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably enjoy. It could be as simple as my love for low-budget, cheesy, Italian movies. Maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed, but I enjoy what I enjoy.  The Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of Devil Fish is actually very enjoyable. I rate Devil Fish a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movie\\'s many flaws. One very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when Tom Servo notes, \"Just because you can edit, doesn\\'t mean you should\" \\xc2\\x96 highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in Devil Fish.',\n",
       " b\"What we have here is a film perfect for anyone that participates in the world of post-industrialism: those who sit in their privatized home, earning money by buying and selling sensual-less commodities and perpetuating a system that values little other than the preservation of self.  The beautiful filming (I always appreciate fix 35s and soft boxes) makes it an even stranger place to travel through, both enjoyable to look at but frightening to comprehend (perhaps that's overly dramatic, but its true).  Andreas' journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. His quest is honorable, laudable, and precious. The conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he's better off, which is the perfect conclusion.  Breve! Highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who don't (perhaps it will encourage a reflection or two).\",\n",
       " b\"A bad movie ABOUT a bad movie. Is that original, or what? If it is, then that's the only good thing about it. The lovely Ally Sheedy couldn't stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and VCR's everywhere. It should also be noted, that she, and the other actors hired by Danny Aiello's character were billed as themselves, as well as the characters they played in his D-rated film. Calling it a B-rated film, is too much of a compliment, and would lead to delusions of grandeur.\",\n",
       " b'This movie was really bad, plain and simple. How a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me.  It\\'s a decent idea, but it just didn\\'t flesh out. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan.  Let\\'s get down to the big issue here.  The visuals were so incredibly bad, I thought I was watching an old \"Dinosaurs In 3D\" CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean, I\\'ve seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean, heck... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one.  The lizard-monkeys were laughable. I thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from \"Killer Instinct\" I\\'ve seen better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it.  You know, there\\'s a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channels \"The Shining\" get such a small audience, but this load of \"CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz\" gets put out in the open? I don\\'t care if it\\'s a Ray Bradbury story.

What do you think?  Fast-moving, colorful cartoon. The animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today. The color and sound have been beautifully restored. Just two problems--the lousy music score and the racism (especially in the title). That aside this is pretty good. An 8.',\n",

All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.  Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard but that's it. And Dutronc looks like he's rather overdone the nips and tucks, if you ask me...\",\n",

(To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film. Color is typical of this '50s time period, ie. too garish and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right either. But certainly Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two best looking female stars in the '50s.\",\n",
       " b\"It is very possible that I simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me (something similar happened with Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have caught on when I put the film on and my roommate, an exchange student from Japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded dumb. Now, I don't agree that it is dumb, the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled. It's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time.  But the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me. It has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. The sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits, for example, are indeed repulsive.  There was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. There is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it.  As I said about Triplets of Belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night TV program like adult swim, or its Japanese counterpart, but an Academy Award nominated film? It gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose from.\",\n",
       " b'\"The Snow Queen\" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaption attempts to capture that story\\'s sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but fails on a number of counts.  Like so many Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There\\'s a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.  That said, \"The Snow Queen\" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It\\'s great eye-candy without being scary, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very, very bold text. Just make sure you read them Andersen\\'s story too.',\n",

Does anyone utter the line \\'I\\'d rather eat a turd\\' in that movie?\"  This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children. Is there that much money in the Beavis and Butt-head demographic to make a series of movies like this? There is a Problem Child 3, but I haven\\'t seen it. I\\'d rather eat a turd.',\n",
       " b'This is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. Furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced. Nothing happens in this film, you would expect a sex scene, but they just have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger that they pick up from the high way. The couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. At this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? No they just kiss and thats it. Also, this film contains no action, no comedy, no drama, and not even suspense. Makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script!!!!',\n",
       " b'This is a good film. This is very funny. Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films!',\n",
       " b'Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn\\'t going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I\\'ll wait until it comes on, then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the film, but they always put on weeknights around midnight.   After discovering a hole in their crowded cell, nine prisoners escape their confinement to track down the key of the universe, which a fellow prisoner known as the Counterfeit King said he had hidden. They think that this key could be an opening for a hidden loot of counterfeit bills. On this journey they naturally see this as an opportunity to pick up their lives before they were gaoled. Although things don\\'t turn out the way that they intended to, with most of the criminals plans going astray.   \"9 Souls\" is an perky spiritual journey from Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, which flung it\\'s viewers into a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story plays out more like a psychical comedy with the criminals bonds and the situations they find themselves being the selling point, but all that makes way to a moralistic and consequence drama-packed second half, where the real trouble begins with some quite nasty and bloody moments replacing the goofball tone it started off with. While, the first half is quite amusing with its on the road, screwball doodling and offbeat banter. But it\\'s really the genuinely haunting latter half with it\\'s peculiar turn of events that hit you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really sympathise for these very human characters. Even though they are not truly innocent from their crimes, you just become entrenched by these flesh-out characters in the first half that when you see them spiral into their downfall, you know it\\'s an effective drama when you become shell-shocked in the dramatic change. The nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal story and what weakness would eventually bring them down. The way the plot works out is that Michiru and Torakichi are the lead characters and we mostly see it from their perspectives. The escapism tale is an unquestionably engaging character study that\\'s clear in it\\'s goal and puts to you many questions on society and the path you choice to take to escape life and free yourself from these restraints.   While, the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element doesn\\'t go by unnoticed, because there\\'s just a dreamy and trance-like vibe that channels itself into the unique atmosphere. What HIGHLY contributed to that factor and gave the film a lift was the sweepingly, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The mellow atmospheric gel it was able to create in many scenes left me rather breathless with the everlasting emotions it was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on that front. The pacing for such an long film ( 2 hours ) seems to breeze by and editing is swiftly done, because we are just so wrapped up in it all. The hypnotic photography is crisp in detail. While, the performances by the cast as a odd bunch of criminals are that of high quality with each one providing enough personality and features to separate themselves.   I found \"9 Souls\" to be a pleasing and quite an amazing surreal film that stirs up the emotions and then it smacks you with an almighty wallop when it changes direction. Highly recommended.',\n",
       " b'A genuinely odd, surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; just what drew Robert Redford to the project, one may never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the kid looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. Disjointed and off-putting--though for some, the sight of Redford disrobing, about to disrobe, or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention. Lauren Hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there simply is no story. Perhaps Furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. If true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach backfired, as the film was not a success. *1/2 from ****',\n",
       " b\"Just got this in the mail and I was positively surprised. As a big fan of 70's cinema it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks. Despite the obvious low budget on this movie, the acting is overall good and you can already see why Pesci was to become on of the greatest actors ever. I'm not sure how authentic this movie is, but it sure is a good contribution to the mob genre.....\",\n",
       " b'I was in Blockbuster and I saw a film called \"Dark Harvest\". The cover art looked great, the plot wasn\\'t that bad, and the tagline (You reap what you sow) made the movie look pretty good. But I was dumb that day, because I did something I should have never done. I rented a \"Straight To Video Independent Horror Film\" Walking out with my much better rentals, I went home, popped Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it began. I figured I would watch the trailer after the film was done (BAD IDEA) but went ahead and watched it anyway. NOW to the review.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* First off, the acting by the \"kids\" sucks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) are talking, the lighting sucks, and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house, where Sean Connel\\'s (I think he\\'s the main character, I don\\'t care) relatives lived there. All of a sudden one by one, they all start getting killed by...(gasp) A KILLER SCARECROW!!!! AHHH!!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget, and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake it\\'s hilarious. It makes dinosaur noises and everything! And then at the end...they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (that is red for god\\'s sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar) and it pauses for a while and then.....(gasp) BLOWS UP!!!!!!  Save yourself some time, I\\'m telling you this movie sucks. if you need to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is A+ fun compared to this disaster. It is quite funny though.  Overall Grade: F If there was anything lower **F-** Than I would give it that.',\n",
       " b\"This is the worst film I've seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. By that I mean a few striking, artsy, images appear randomly, without any sustaining framework. The fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. This device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time.\",\n",
       " b\"Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...  Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skelton's girlfriends. All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role.  Well worth your time.\",\n",

Borrowing some papers from their neighbors actor? Terrible plot, awful acting. Heh ... why do you take us for an imbeciles? What can I say more. I understand this is an TV production and the acting is not supposed to be the one from Citizen Kane. But nevertheless they should try it harder in order to earn their money. And apart from that what can be said IN 10 LINES for a simple movie like this? U wanna article in the morning paper? To say what? Worse film in the decade? OK, you want it - you got it!\",\n",
       " b'We chose to see this movie as an alternative to The Polar Express showing at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it is not cute. The Snowman, at times, looked demonic. Other times, he was simply a zombie. He showed no expression or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy.  Secondly, Santa states in the beginning it\\'s a movie about the spirit of giving. Santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? I\\'m all for a little parody, but this just wasn\\'t funny or entertaining.  The idea that the Snowman\\'s flute is his voice is different. Too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute...not even a \"thank you\" to Santa.  The only funny parts of the movie were the \"outtakes\" at the end of the film. Too bad they didn\\'t use them in the movie. It would have been better.',\n",
       " b\"Thank God this has not been renewed by ITV.  This series, while popular (God knows why) has a very simple - 'Look I've found another body behind the flowers/bushes/trees/wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time this series' plot. The dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children - talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point.  They just 'happen' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary - and no-one notices them.  Every time they look into and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - messing up the lives of all - including those completely innocent.  They break and enter into people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) being nosey and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. They never apologise, never get caught or arrested (and if they do they can talk their way out of it, even though another character who does the same gets put in prison!!!).  They always come up trumps. Now I know that this is an easy going series, but I think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes! Put simply, it's unrealistic.  I think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the Continent (where they are every other week), so I do hope it never comes back.  ITV should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - 'someone's been murdered at the village fair - again' type series.\",\n",
       " b'DANGER: Watch for falling spoilers...  Boy, was this a bad movie. I know that they were going for a \"true love conquers all\" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which I will never get back. The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. Kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta\\'s father. At first Gerta ignores Kai\\'s advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gerta\\'s father. As if this obstacle wasn\\'t enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kai\\'s eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly. Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queen\\'s fortress (Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (All the while you will want to turn it off, but can\\'t force yourself to do it. It\\'s probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyways, I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. So, in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy.',\n",
       " b'I would have to say this is a great movie.   Mike Judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence Office Space. Hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. Yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across. But the genuine frustration on Private Joe Bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives.   If you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again. It took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it is\\xc2\\x85And with said after watching it twice\\xc2\\x85I am going to read a book now.',\n",
       " b'For many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with affectionate parodies of classic films and a hilarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognisable catchphrases. Few shows have survived transition from radio to TV to stage show to film but The League of Gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb.  The talented writer/performers had initially envisioned a Monty Python style medieval adventure, but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better. With that, the Royston Vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th Century romp instead.  With the exception of Michael Sheen playing much unseen League member Jeremy Dyson, The League play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of Tubbs (\"I made a little brown fishy\"), nightmare inducing sexual predator Herr Lipp, butcher Hilary Briss and an unlikely hero - irate businessman Geoff Tibbs. New faces appear when the third reality appears, it\\'s here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular TV stars. For many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes.  \\'Apocalpse is not going to please everyone though. Working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kick-started by the likes of Wes Craven having a New Nightmare. It also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know. Comedy as a genre is formulaic but it\\'s now unheard of for a British film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of TV stars to fill short amounts of screen time. It\\'s also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off, which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn\\'t always quite hit the mark. Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try save Royston Vasey in the series?  However, while the show\\'s deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it. Much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like Herr Lipp. It is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs. Sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action. The music is good, performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless; a nice throwback to Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen\\'s work. In short, there\\'s a lot to like about the Apocalypse. Like so many TV to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the League\\'s slick and distinct voice. But no matter what your preference is, this last trip to the town which \\'You\\'ll Never Leave\\' is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very, very touching.',\n",
       " b\"Why bother to see this movie? It probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since Clark Gable's laughable playing of an Irish patriot in Parnell.  It's inconceivable that Bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative Hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time. To begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. Then we are supposed to believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman she doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous Bergman in such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.  So she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. A place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.  Her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. On top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. She even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. Since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. To her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. I won't bother to tell you how this all ends. The no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (from seeing it on late night TV) that it had two different endings! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast Bergman. It led to her downfall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. I kid you not. It's pretty embarrassing.  - - SoundTrack\",\n",
       " b\"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.\",\n",
       " b'This is a hard show to watch. It\\'s not something to sit back and relax to. It kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People get screwed over, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there is excrement, puke and blood. Oz is a brave show. It brings up issues like racism, homosexuality, prisoners reality and most of all; -capital punishment. It is, in my opinion also successful in doing so, unlike for example, the single-tracked \"Medium\".  It bored me sometimes. It had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didn\\'t interest me. Strangely enough, I found season 1 to be quite boring. If I had watched it while it aired I think I wouldn\\'t have continued to watch it. I love seasons 2 - 4. Season 5 and 6 are watchable, (although I think it shouldn\\'t be allowed to utter the words \"Cyril\" and \"Death Row\" in the same sentence)  There are so many marvelous characters to root for. The old guys Bob and Busmalis, who I absolutely fell in love with from day one. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, who\\'s monologues tied the episodes together so efficient. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada-also brilliant. Also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression as well.  My favorites are the O\\'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most gut-wrenching and warmest I seen on television. If there is anything I will always remember about this show it\\'s them. There will never be another \"pairing\" or what to call it, that will make me ache so much. Thats why, when the ends come for them as well, it almost hurt to much. I wish it would never have happened. I wish I had never watched it.  But good one Fontana. I do recommend it.',\n",
       " b\"I haven't seen all Cage's works by any means but his acting in this one was truly awful. The other characters run the gamut of ability but, having most of the emotional scenes, Cage's scenes are just embarrassing to watch. He's certainly come a long ways in 12 years.\",\n",
       " b\"For those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget Hollywood films, on huge screens with a surround audio, this film seems to be so distant. However it surprised me how close can it be to any human while I watch it. It is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it. You are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it. For me, the time I spend on watching a film is the only time which I go to another world. This film is the first sample for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films, surround audio capabilities to go to another world. This films sends you to another world (or maybe makes you return back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget, or technical capabilities. I felt like that I'm reading L'etranger from Camus.\",\n",
       " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   One time heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of prison to his bumbling jailbird partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), needy cripple of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and bit on the side Molly (Kim Novak.) He's trying to make it big as a drummer in a band, but until his big break comes along he's stuck doing the only other thing he was any good at other than being a junkie- dealing cards in high stakes games. And try as he might, even prison hasn't cured him of his addiction to the devil's drug- causing him to lie to and deceive all those around him and driving him to desperate measures to feed his habit. His yearning to come off it is his only motivation towards a happy ending.  When people think of Frank Sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like Under My Skin, New York New York and It Had to Be You. But lest anyone forget he was actually a renowned actor too and, if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity wasn't enough, he will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse.  The film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use (probably the reason behind the 15 certificate) in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground. In his portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the despair, desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make an impression is Parker as Machine's demanding, needy cripple of a wife, using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can. Novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comic relief thing, as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with his waspy New York accent.  Director Otto Preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life. ****\",\n",
       " b\"First off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!\",\n",
       " b'I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got \"Spanish Judges\" on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it wasn\\'t back-ordered. But either way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I\\'m surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man, what a good actor.  The story it about a con artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who \"claims\" to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don\\'t know what Spanish Judges are or haven\\'t seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won\\'t even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D\\'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won\\'t even tell anyone her name because she\\'s from Mars, as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her \"Mars Girl\". Everything starts out fine, but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal.  There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). There were some scenes they could\\'ve done better and the score could\\'ve been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that\\'s my opinion. The fight scene in the end could\\'ve been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man.  I know this is a review, but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been acting since 1983. To me, and hopefully to others, she is well known as Charlie Sheen\\'s Italian love interest in both the \"Hot Shots!\" movies. But good review.  Although I think it\\'s one of the rare films I\\'ve seen and it\\'s really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it.  8/10',\n",
       " b\"This is a pretty silly film, including what may well be the least erotic come-on ever to make it to the big screen (the heroine pours V-8 all over herself and invites the hero to lick it off -- yuck!). And yet it also features the resplendent Lucinda Dickey in what is far and away her most erotic performance. In those long ago days, women -- even action heroines -- with real muscles were a rarity, and I can still remember the way my jaw dropped when Dickey took off her shirt, revealing the most powerfully built female back and biceps I'd ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could have been a female Schwarzenegger if anybody had had the vision to promote her.\",\n",

I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and I was about Nikki's age and for the longest time I bugged my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course I expected the same thing to happen to me!

A nice little flick, though not for every taste.\",\n",
       " b'A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story.  But what a vomitous movie!   In Bradbury\\'s science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path, a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury\\'s tale was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect.  A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science fiction story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury\\'s story, the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity\\'s existence itself.  While in the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes, like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury\\'s powerful tale, except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury\\'s story - baboon-faced reptiles, plants overrunning Chicago\\'s concrete, time waves rippling through the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers.  Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts.  I can\\'t possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog, but here is just one, spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of \"scientist\": he refers to the Pleiades star cluster, \"The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, don\\'t they? But each of them is a whole galaxy.\" Uh, no, idiot scientist, they\\'re actually, uh, stars.  Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury\\'s story forgot they didn\\'t know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing.  Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick\\'s chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses.  --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy\\'s Movie Mania).',\n",
       " b'An intense, dark action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith, et. al, many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it. The film is oddly shaped -- often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well-done seemingly improved dialogues -- during the stakeouts, almost all of the \"Machine\" get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues -- and Reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having Reynolds the star step back and give them room. And unlike most action films, you really get to like the characters, which makes the 2nd half, when their various destinies good and bad unfold, unusually affecting. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan -- watch this & then \"Jackie Brown\" and you\\'ll see what I\\'m talking about)make this occasionally flawed film (The bad guys are a bit melodramatic) one of the better modern cop films, and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as \"Body Heat\" & such.',\n",
       " b\"There are a number of movies that my high school friends and I used to joke about. They are mostly the campy works of the 50's that showed up on television on the late show. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native being brought to life in a tree stump with a scowl on its face. Now my friends claimed that if you looked carefully, you could see the thing had shoes. I never saw this. What is most striking to me is that the natives seemed to be white men with black grease paint on their faces; some looked sort of Italian. They also spoke with the strangest timbre that didn't seem to fit their situation. Like the mummy movies, the mobility of the thing didn't seem to offer much of a threat. In a confrontation, one should only have to walk fast; I guess it's the old element of surprise. If you see this, don't take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us such joy.\",\n",

From the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. For starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. Then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an Oscar candidate. And to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. The towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. So obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. Its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. And maybe a decent script would have helped too.\",\n",
       " b'Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job at tackling a very challenging exercise: making dry political events work as human drama, and providing an even-handed representation of explosively controversial subject matter.  The key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps\\' performance as Gough Whitlam than some other commenters here. The clear standouts for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second count, the series avoids the \"myth of objectivity\" trap through a narrator who articulates the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated his left-wing credentials in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being carefully even-handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr/Lady Macbeth theme popular among Labor partisans was perhaps a little partial, though not ruinously so. In particular, credit is due for the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position he was placed in, whatever one might think of his actions.  However, there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns/Juni Morosi affair. Those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign by a prurient gutter press. The producers may have been restrained in this respect by Australia\\'s stultifying defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before his death). However, more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which Morosi managed Cairns\\'s office as Treasurer.  Speaking of defamation, there are a couple of disorienting occasions where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions taken out by offended principals - by a beeping noise on one occasion, and a very loud telephone ring on another. A further curiosity: the DVD release excises a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by the late Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a dishevelled looking hippie, who now receives only a disapproving glare from Chubb when he presents his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb said something along the lines of: \"drug bust in Bali, eh?\". Obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the Schapelle Corby case, which dramatically illustrated that those busted for drugs in Bali can expect far worse than deportation.',\n",
       " b'I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.  We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun, GI Jane, An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission. The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part.  There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives. However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall \"do his own thing as a trainer\", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud, gasp here and there, and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie.  We all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and, I think, you will too.',\n",
       " b\"The Women is a cute movie about women at all ages (but mostly 30+) and their issues in life. Not just men and infidelity, but also about relationships with friends & family, making time to connect with others, problems with image, compromising your values, accomplishments in life, and finding what will really make you happy.  It's also about being true to yourself. A lot of times, people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves. Sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Granted, it was trying a bit to be like Sex & the City at times, but that probably helped me like it. The difference here is it's kind of like the discoveries after the stage in life that the Sex & the City stars were in -- here, most are married or past the point of trying to find a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives.  Obviously it's not an Oscar contender, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose.  And for the men out there, there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater (most were with their wives/girlfriends), and the men were in fact laughing. :)\",\n",

       " b\"The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.  The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking she will be helped, then Ryan's personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll/Hyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knife.  Worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.\",\n",
       " b\"WARNING: PLOT SPOILER  The always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality.   Despite the excessive use of\\xc2\\x85 weirdness it does prove a point- virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the movie, a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying' (assuming that she was still in the game). But it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life-like game. `eXistenZ' leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways.   Despite some extra gadgets and gook, it was simply your classic `it was all a dream\\xc2\\x85 or was it' twist. It is a smart surprise and answers a few questions, but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing. At only 97 minutes it could have went on a bit longer too. In a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way.   Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while. But her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character. Jude Law on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through his perspective.  `eXistenZ' is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember. There's tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what next? - being consumed by a question mark?!?!?!). It definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend. My IMDb rating: 6.2/10.\",\n",
       " b\"A very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation, which is all to rare these days. I would compare this film to The Day of the Jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. The acting across the board is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist Carlos and as the Navy man who impersonates him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it. The first half of the film is all set-up, as the Navy man prepares to impersonate Carlos. The second half is a breathless actioner, the action coming out of the characters and their situations, thus making it all the more gripping. A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.\",\n",
       " b\"OK enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is appalling (do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world. anna massey is 'acting' in such an unbelievable fashion. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond. also the bertram girls aren't pretty enough, and the guy playing henry crawford is awful. to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. i watched this adaptation over Christmas, and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this, and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time.  i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations. so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie. but see any other adaptation instead, even emma is better than this.\",\n",

The plot centers around an EU space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the Earth. They send a maned mission (they have been to Mars and have yet to discover this planet? Is anybody stupid enough to fall for this?) to the planet and can you believe it, it\\'s the mirror image of the planet they came from. Most everything is predictable from that point. Honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything. The only surprising thing here is a maned space program run by Eurpoeans :) There really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. So it\\'s good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.',\n",
       " b\"One wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, who we first meet on a plane, as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy. When we first see him, he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading. Rather rudely, he asks her if he could have the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. Well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is to give him the front section she is reading.  Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it.  The film presents Leland, a teen ager who can't even differentiate between fantasy and reality. It's evident that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn't done anything to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family, and the family of the slain boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about it.  It's obvious Leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce. His own father is an aloof man who couldn't care less about him. It's Pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he doesn't have a chance.  The best thing in the film is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The ensemble cast does good work under Mr. Hoge's direction. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiot.  Although a bit long, the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered.\",\n",

It was John Huston\\'s last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. The Dead is poetical in its approach on the screen, telling us more about Ireland than any modern movie on the IRA and \"the troubles\" could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both John Huston and James Joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).',\n",

Okay, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick, and eyebrows (Only Madonna could get away with that). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your ordinary girl. She makes things happen, always exciting to be around, and always honest. Sure, she steals, but she doesn't rob or murder (unless you're out to do her in). She knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed. She knows what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she's in 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (which is why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those she loves, and who love her.  Who's That Girl? She's the girl for me.\",\n",

He's supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of some stupid cult!! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, please expect no more than pointless murders and gore.\",\n",
       " b\"So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc. Needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the sanctimonious do-gooders. Lest I forget, there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the holier-than-thou posse gets picked off one by one, but they probably comprise less than 2% of the film. The main event pitting our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest Dino-Crisis video game.  The acting is pretty bad overall, even for this sort of film. Half the actors seem like they're more concerned with pronouncing every last syllable of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner.  I actually did make it through to the end, but it's one of those movies I wish I would have recorded and then watched later, because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast forwarded through. Overall, I give this effort one star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B-movie fun to watch. It's a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching Boa vs. Python.\",\n",
       " b\"This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.  It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.  She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.  Don't miss this movie.\",\n",
       " b'Having just finished reading the book \"One of a Kind\" a week ago, I was thinking \"This would make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players\". I was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night. I had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film. I grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation. What a major letdown!  All of the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were skimmed over quickly, and instead I was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody. Ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively. That is what made him so fascinating. Why not focus on that?  And talk about watering down the real truth. This guy was excessive about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep-deprivation. He gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards. Now that\\'s a story!  Too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties with \"Vincent\" and his daughter were hardly touched on) and hardly anything about his drugs use (which was exorbitant), his insane gambling and his incredible card-playing abilities.  Probably too late now, but I hope someone remakes this film properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script just left him with nothing interesting to say.',\n",
       " b\"What starts off fairly well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinks into an annoying mess.  Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister infamy) apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea, and while the idea of a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest non-endings you'll ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel. This really looks like it's going to be a good low-budget effort.  No such luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider's character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue. Worse, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet.  What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there is a new twisted Sister song, if you care.\",\n",
       " b\"What can you expect from a direct to DVD film? You know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this. The quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows.   Why are they shots always up so close to the actors!? And why are they always centered? There isn't anything to look at. (And the actors are that great looking, so that blows.)  The writing and dialogue is just plain awful. That intro scene, with the British Guy is hilarious. Just try and listen this words, they hardly make any sense, just goes around in circles. The lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci-fi novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. The characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying.   This is a terrible movie. I feel bad for the actors tied to this project. Embarrassing!\",\n",
       " b'No this is not an Ed Wood movie. \"Angora Love\" is Stan Laurel\\'s and Oliver Hardy\\'s last silent movie. The end of an era! In the \\'20\\'s Laurel & Hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly, this present day.  It\\'s a shame that this movie is however not among their best.  The premise of the movie sounds good and is good. The boys team up with a goat this time, which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch. It however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat. Most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable. The comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable.  Of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent Laurel & Hardy entry.  7/10',\n",
       " b\"Well, I'm not about to add to the diatribe that's been 'preached' about this film.  All I can add is that at NO time does it even pretend to be a 'historic' picture. Unlike 'Braveheart', 'Titanic' or 'The Patriot' all of which have very credible and serious historical amendments, purely for theatric effect (possible the worst of excuses).   Has everyone taken a sense of humor bypass?   All I can add is a paraphrase from the good Captain Macleane - 'It looked  fantastic and we have a bloody good laugh'.  - One last point. What astonishes me is that there are comments relating to the 'modern music' in a historic setting. I wonder if the same people made the same judgment about Moulin Rouge. I suggest not.\",\n",

       " b'Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will be obvious from the start that it was made long before anyone ever thought of political correctness. Although, the Ward Bond character softens the edge with \"maybe we can communicate with them, after all they\\'re humans, too\" type of dialogue. His part stands side-by-side with the preacher attemtping to communicate with the Martians in War of the Worlds. In fact, it\\'s uncanny. The title is curious too. Use of the word \"Incident\" contributes an importance and sophistication to the film that probably didn\\'t hurt boxoffice.

At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner.   The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.  Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.\",\n",
       " b\"I'm sorry but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked big-time. How in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house? Why did the father come back again? WHy did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? To many questions, not enough answers. If I could've gave it a zero, I would've.\",\n",
       " b\"Set in the Philipines, Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.  The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work. The ballistic action scenes are an unimpressive mixture of 'slow-motion flying-through-the-air-whilst-shooting' heroics, crazy vehicle stunts, and endless bad guys lining up to be shot.  With so many better examples of the 'girls and guns' genre now available on DVD, I suggest that you leave this one well alone (unless, like me, you'll endure pretty much any old rubbish in order to be a completist).\",\n",
       " b\"simply i just watched this movie just because of Sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her,on the other side This movie was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Theacting was horrible. The script was uninspired. This was a movie that kept contradicting itself. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like I was expecting a good film. Just something to give me a jump or two. This did not even do that.  he worst thing is that, the more I think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding. A real shame really, as I'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere...  I'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again SARA obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered far more.  This movie is just crap, I cant put it differently. Since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap.  The story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much EVERYTHING sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing, I can't believe how somebody produced this thing.  It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream/reality experience. The development of the movie is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is... Doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I wish I knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) Please, make yourselves a favor and do NOT watch this.  P.S. It's also full of clich\\xc3\\xa9s! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad directing, Bad cinematography. P.S. 3 I bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone.\",\n",

Cigarette hanging from his lips, Borden is playing one of his own compositions. Priscilla Lane\\'s Ann Lemp tells him the piece is beautiful. But he says, \"It stinks.\" He continues: \"It hasn\\'t got a beginning or an end, only a middle.\" Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies, \"What for? The fates are against me. They tossed a coin--heads I\\'m poor, tails I\\'m rich. But they tossed a two-headed coin.\" Audiences loved the way Garfield, in his tough city voice, said It stinks. That scene created Garfield\\'s screen persona as the eternal outsider. Four Daughters is a slice of Americana with Garfield, in a compelling performance, supplying more than a hint of darkness.

The film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot, though I don't believe all of it is true. This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy Chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!\",\n",
       " b'This movie and its subsequent TV series followup has become the iconic stand-in for what is great about America.   Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standouts including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara*, and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The latter who plays a walk-on dancer with no academic or other than \"street\" credentials is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself. A wonderment to behold, as one king was apt to say.  The plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre at other times, personalities in some cases ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.  Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step.  The climax of the film is a climax for all times. And this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits. These are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through ... an achievement for the ages. The music by Christopher Gore is a gift to behold.',\n",
       " b'This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course its fake. But it is agonizing to watch. I personally know more creative film influenced minds that could \"make\" this seem real. The young lead male couldn\\'t be more unconvincing. He line-reads everything he says. Are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about? There is a plethora of ways to Blair-Witch this show up. Fear does not breed from what seems \"cool\" and computer generated. Nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as \"What was that? Did you hear that?\" Also, There are real convincing psychics out there that don\\'t just \"Want to be on screen\". Another DUH-Factor is... how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) they film. I don\\'t think so. A 2 + week at one site would be more convincing. It is also disarming that they think including \"Nasa radar checks\" and computer\\'s that show fancy bs really make us scared. AND IE: Exorcisms should not be staged like the film \"The Exorcist\". When are they going to get it right? Possession of the Devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. They don\\'t just snarl and lower their voice like Linda Blair or fallel around like Courtney Love on a drug binge. As stated better concentrations on \"psychic ability\" would aid this show greatly. We want to see and hear EVERYTHING that supposingly flashes before them. Not cut-away to other story bs. On a final note- Shooting Stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of UFO\\'s ahead of time. Might I stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down-right awful. Avoid this show. For fright: watch old Unsolved Mystery episodes... not the new ones (the recreation got it oh-so wrong). But that is for a different blog.',\n",
       " b\"This movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. There's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. Others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. Overall this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie so did his Dad.\",\n",
       " b'This is a film that really makes me cringe. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the \"Crusader Rabbit\" series on TV)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture\\'s cynical ploy worked!! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later, it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy, I blame, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story isn\\'t that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying \"boing-boing\" incessantly is a pain.',\n",

Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques \"Spanish Judges\" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece.  The low budget \"Spanish Judges\" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D\\'Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny. My vote is three.

I am surprised to see Will Patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a \"c\" movie like this.

       " b'An ear-splitting movie, a quasi-old-fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star Madonna\\'s comedic attributes. She does indeed go far out on the proverbial limb here playing a beyond-vivacious parolee attempting to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she ran a red light...big laughs). After an energetic animated credits sequence--which is much more fun than the rest of the picture--we have nothing to look at but Madonna\\'s black mascara and red lips set off by her platinum hair and pale complexion. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated playing Maddy\\'s keeper, while the poor-choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue. It\\'s an unfortunate set-back to the talents of director James Foley, who unwisely allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s (but even Katharine Hepburn in \"Bringing Up Baby\" had a human side). Wretched. * from ****',\n",
       " b\"This begins a series (which I'll hopefully keep up every week-end) of films that came out during my childhood \\xc2\\x96 in this case, it's one I've only managed to catch now. It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject, which basically had been debased to the level of hokum over the years; however, in its uncompromising striving for a serious-minded approach (a sure measure of which is that the protagonist is never once referred to by the name he's been known all this time the world over!), the film-makers rather lost track of the fact that the thing was intended primarily as entertainment! Consequently, we get a decidedly staid representation of events \\xc2\\x96 with more care given to meticulous period reconstruction than in providing a functional thematic environment for its mythic jungle hero! Even so, Christopher Lambert rose to stardom \\xc2\\x96 as did another debutante, Andie McDowell, playing his love interest (named Jane, of course) \\xc2\\x96 with the title role, which he handles creditably enough under the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, this being his swan-song) steals every scene he's in as Tarzan's natural grandfather who, in spite of showing obvious affection for his long-lost kin, can't bring himself to forget tradition in an effort to understand his predicament; the hero, in fact, is much more comfortable interacting with primates (even contriving, after having gone back home, to save his adoptive 'dad' from captivity). The film is otherwise very good to look at (with cinematography by Stanley Kubrick regular John Alcott, no less), features an appropriately grandiose score as well as remarkable make-up effects (by Rick Baker) \\xc2\\x96 and, while essentially disappointing as a Tarzan outing, retains considerable value nonetheless as a prestige picture of its day.\",\n",

Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere.

       " b'I was Stan in the movie \"Dreams Come True\". Stan was the friend that worked at the factory with the main character and ended getting his arm smashed in the machinery and got carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) The acting in this movie was for the most part pretty poor with mostly local actors from the Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. It played 2 nights in 3 theaters and was something special to see yourself on the big screen. I may be bias, but overall, I enjoyed it. Also the soundtrack was the band Spooner, who later became Garbage. My brother, Steve Charlton was also in the movie. He played Swenson the man who comes to the door on crutches to talk with the police.',\n",
       " b\"First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that I rented it, I wanted to like it.  I think that the main reason that I was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. In my eyes, a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.  This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.His notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.  The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. The film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.\",\n",

This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.

Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has at times been a gritty, well acted, believable and dare I say, entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least, never failed to \"get their man\"!

       " b\"Poor Diane Arbus (whoever she was). Not only was she (according to this movie) a spoiled-but-sweet-acting upper East Side brat, she was a bad wife, bad mother, awful business partner; plus there is no evidence in this picture that she was any kind of an artist -- except in the bold statement in the prologue.  Nicole Kidman, who incredibly is more attractive today than 25 years ago and actually looks younger, indeed gives an excellent performance; but what can an actress do with a wife and mom who seeks out and falls for an incredibly weird werewolf-looking guy living in the apartment upstairs? Set in the early 1970's, Manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and weirdo's of all sizes and shapes, most not looking like human hairballs; so why is this affair worthy of a 122 minute movie?  Robert Downey Jr used to be one of my favorites, but I'd say his well known and prolonged use of drugs has taken its toll. One might think he'd be disinclined to be in a movie that treats drug use as casually as it does smoking cigarettes.   FUR has already taken a beating at the box office, but in view of those who input a score of 10 for this misbegotten slice of trash, I'd like to say, 'taint so, McGee.\",\n",
       " b'In one of the more under-seen films of the late 1980\\'s, at a time when Oliver Stone was riding high with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his opus Born on the Fourth of July), he co-scripted and directed this look at the world of radio, specifically one radio host in the middle of Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, in a once-in-a-career turn from Eric Bogosian, who wrote the original play and also co-wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those pundits you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off. He\\'s got ideas on his mind, opinions, and he\\'s not only un-afraid to speak them, but also to stand up against the phone callers. The callers, indeed, are the driving force in the film, as Barry has to combat against the mindless, the obscene, the racist, and the purely absent-minded. As this goes on, he also has to contend with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and a hit or miss deal to go nationwide, outside the confines of the Southern way station he\\'s in.  While after seeing the film I felt curious as to see how it would\\'ve been done on stage (I\\'d imagine it was a one-man show, as Bogosian has had several on the side), the direction of the film is phenomenal. Stone has been known, almost typecast, as a director who loves quick cuts, the limitless effects of montage, and effects with the styles of camera-work and other little tricks, that give his films in the 90\\'s a distinctive, almost auteur look. But in the 80\\'s he had this energy and feverish quality to the look of the film, and wasn\\'t as frenzied as the other films. In order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and head-space of Barry Champlain, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times, gritty, un-sure, and definitely on edge. The scenes in the middle of the film, when Barry isn\\'t in the studio, are fairly standard, but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best I\\'ve seen from the Stone/Richardson combination.  And one cannot miscalculate the performance of Bogosian, who can be obnoxious, offensive, angered, passive, and everything that we love and hate in radio show hosts. There is also a funny, near distracting supporting role for Michael Wincott as Kent/Michael/Joe, who prank calls him one night, and the next gets invited to the studio. These scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer, but it does get very much into the subculture head-space of the 80\\'s that Barry is as intrigued as he is critical of. The stoner may not \\'get it\\', but as he says to him \"it\\'s your show\". Indeed, it\\'s hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk, and there is a lot of it. But it\\'s never boring, and like Champlain himself, it\\'s not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian goes into his climactic tirade on air, with the background panning around in a continuous 360 spin, it becomes intoxicating, and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful.  Stone has been synonymous as a filmmaker of hot-button issues, who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial, and gives them a life-force that isn\\'t always great, but is all his own. Here his skills and ambitions don\\'t get in the way of Bogosian\\'s- it\\'s boosted, if anything, making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near one-man show, which in and of itself is already well-written.',\n",
       " b\"I remember when this NBC mini-series aired when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I'd check out some adaptations. Didn't expect much out of a TV mini-series, but now I might have to check out some more. This is actually excellent, and the best possible film version that could be made. Writer Simon Moore, who wrote the teleplay for the original Traffic mini-series, upon which the Soderberg film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly: he frames Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the actual story beginning as Gulliver first returns home (everything having happened on one journey). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is sort of crazy-seeming when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, welcomes him back into his home. Unfortunately, the house is now owned by the local doctor, James Fox, who has designs on Steenburgen. Gulliver seems merely disturbed at first, but when he starts telling stories of tiny people, that's all the evidence Fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. All four of Gulliver's travels are related in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time this has been done on film). I love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's small son, whom he has never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians, and the doctors' scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the Laputans and the professors at the Academy. Finally, when he is put on trial he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The cast of this thing is amazing, and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw of the mini-series is that the acting is really uneven. You have all these fine actors, but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of L.A. Law, but don't do well in a costume drama. Ted Danson isn't especially great, although he has a few sequences where he excels. It's probably better that he didn't attempt one, but all the other characters of the film speak in an English accent. Steenburgen is actually pretty good at it, and is quite good overall. Another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly. It's not believable that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as is claimed. But, in general, it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while, with its structure, adding a new emotional level.\",\n",
       " b'This movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch, I mean it wasn\\'t great but it was one of the better horror movies of late. It seems to have been low, almost state benefit budget size but it has it\\'s charms like the lovely ladies in it. The atmosphere was good also (which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days). The acting was your typical 80\\'s low budget affair, that being in case you don\\'t know is that it is \"dud\" acting. But that is what Lucio Fulci\\'s movies were full of, they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc. They more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it\\'s self.  It is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, I watched it all the way and I love horror movies. I\\'ve seen movies where I just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it\\'s on video, or skip scene\\'s on the DVD. This movie didn\\'t make me want to do that, I sat and watched it all the way to the end, without wanting to skip parts.  I would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter, not. But seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.  The music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. I\\'ve seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better, thank goodness though this movie didn\\'t have nay of the Metal music in it.  I\\'ve been a die-hard Metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing. So i\\'m glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy, well done.  It could have use \"Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams\" on it though. As it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except \"really\" creepy keyboard tracks. Like track one \"Forever Sleep\" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it. Ever track on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at it\\'s best, it would have suited this movie perfectly.  The only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed/killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung up as a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. Every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed, a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one I mentioned above.  I wish that Hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to Romero and the guy who made this movie. As giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called Paul Anderson of the \"resident evil\" mince.  Well done guys, it is not bad, not bad at all, I loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie (behind the scene\\'s) Not many movies do this kind of thing, which I thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that\\'s always a good thing if you ask me.  Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5/10.',\n",
       " b\"It's not like an historical movie, it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario, but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere...  It had that 60's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor apartment in Paris, each one making art, dreaming of changing the world, doing drugs and loving in his very own way.  It takes a lot of patience to watch, and a special mood, that if you're not in, you might find it extremely boring and dull.  I liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives: the fear for their future, the difficulty of earning their living, the obstacles in following their dreams.  What i absolutely loved was the black & white image. The still camera angles were amazing, they were like freezing moments. It left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very emotive and suggestive photographs. I actually had to see the movie again, just to take those amazing screen-shots.  In one word: beautiful...\",\n",
       " b'OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well documented failings. This however was the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD the effects are vastly superior. However the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone\\'s favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the \"characters\" consistently verge on the moronic. I feel like trying out Uwe Boll\\'s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. OK there it is.

       " b\"First I have to say that I have read everything about this subject and I know it inside out, and I was excited about finally seeing it, too. But you have to read only the book this mini-series is based on to realize that it's not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It's loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the scriptwriter's imagination. And unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary.  Where do I begin? Vita and Violet didn't use the names Mitya and Lushka until their affair started, and during it Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The 'seduction' scene when their affair started Violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn't kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series was only just started. Besides all these alterations from the facts, the characterizations are also all wrong. At times Vita behaves like a mad woman. Especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper Violet's engagement announcement is just ridiculous. Vita kept her surges of emotion inside. It was Violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. All Vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted, that's all. Being a gentle nature, Harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet... I know that this series purposely concentrated on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here she is totally one-dimensional character, and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow. Actually she was intelligent, gifted, quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves. I have always thought her much more interesting person than Vita. In this series her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. Viewer has also little clue of her background and family, what kind of relation (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she battled over Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and if Harold suffered during affair, so did Violet. After it her life was in ruins, and it took time that she could pull herself back together again. Statue could have acted the role of Denys, that much depth his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent.   The series ends to the totally badly written scene in Amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to scriptwriter. No, it continued a whole year after that, and it's ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. But what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start. I have to give some credit to actors, they tried to make best of those roles given to them though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really shines through. One can't complain the settings either. All complaints go to director and most of all, scriptwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. Many of the scenes are too long, some are pointless and don't bring anything to the story line. On the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether. Especially there should have been more information about Vita's and Violet's youth, and how their friendship developed. This is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it. At the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or Violet's letters to Vita, which are brilliant stuff.\",\n",

       " b\"Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in the 70s, this is the stagiest of all. It's so stagy, you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very, very big budget school play, or indeed, a very very low budget action movie, which it actually is. It's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and I do hope it was. The genre didn't die peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.  Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed, there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworldly accent.  The triple bill, currently on the market, features this film plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this film. Get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see. After all, the makers didn't have any shame either.\",\n",
       " b\"Weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. Randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. None of that explains why this is such a bad film.  It's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. The acting is flat. Even the sparkling Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. You may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in Japan learning to sign and dance. Read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. Even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.  The cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. The editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. Just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent Zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.\",\n",
       " b'Purported documentary that tries to examine sci-fi films of the 1950s and how they affected (and REflected) America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill narrates.  Pretty terrible. The \"insights\" that are given are nothing new--for instance--the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children. Well-duh! They try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci-fi films of the 1950s--the big bug movies, invaders from space movies etc etc. That\\'s good but they choose the most obvious films and they\\'ve been over analyzed to death already. It was cool seeing clips from \"Rocketship X-M\", \"Destination Moon\", \"Forbidden Planet\", \"The Thing\" and \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it\\'s insulting.

In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.  At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.  The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise give this film a wide girth. Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.\",\n",
       " b'I finally watched the third film in Mehta\\'s trilogy: \"Fire\". To begin, I\\'d say that \"Water\" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I\\'ll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of \"heat\" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships.   Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from. India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of \"Water\" after having had the script cleared, shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face, cannot examine or discuss them. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats. So, as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. Whereas \"Earth\" was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence, Fire and Water are pointing at personal, social and religious issues, which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away. As I write this \"Water\" is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year. I\\'ll believe it when I see it.   Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in \"A price above rubies\". Whether it\\'s arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago, or like it is among many modern Indians), they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or, just plain loveless marriages..... However, this is not the real issue. Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire). I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case Mehta\\'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny. That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack. I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough. Superb, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.',\n",

       " b'\"Glen or Glenda\" was Edward D. Wood Jr\\'s first attempt at directing a feature film. For this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism, the \"art\" of a man wanting to dress in women\\'s clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film.  The story opens with a prologue by Bela Lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen/Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way.  Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. And that\\'s it. We see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street dressed as either Glen or Glenda and looking longingly at women\\'s clothes in a store window. Poor old Bela, who was down on his luck and befriended by Wood, keeps popping in throughout the story. I\\'m not 100% sure but I think Bela\\'s scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed.  To add to the confusion of Lugosi\\'s narration, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off screen narration. Lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare...take care, take care, as well as, some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog\\'s tails.  The story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood\\'s character(s). The dream sequences are laughable. A wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination, risqu\\xc3\\xa9 for 1953.  This film along with Wood\\'s other \"classics\" were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For that reason, they have survived to this day.',\n",

Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be?  DON\\'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac. The chills just jump right off the screen. You probably won\\'t have to say \"It\\'s only a movie, it\\'s only a movie\", it isn\\'t that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which I do. It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon. Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn\\'t have excellent effects and/or isn\\'t considered a classic doesn\\'t have a chance with an audience. But I think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.',\n",

It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.

Of course Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who likes stand-up and political discussion. And the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this. Everybody knows Hollywood is more liberal/democrat than the bush&co so they have to make these movies every now and then...but this one was perhaps too obvious, at least I thought so, for making any real change.  Still, great stand-up and fresh political issues and talks...I enjoyed it and thanks to IMDb.com ratings I was positively surprised when I walked out from the movie theater, and yes, I laughed many times.

Lara Flynn Boyle was awesome in her guest role. I wish they hadn't killed her off. The show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on TV.

       " b\"Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount.   Mr. Bug Goes to Town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that. --The sad closing of a great quirky, innovative chapter in American animation.  I wanted to comment, also, that the film actually debuted December 4, 1941, not December 7. That may have been close enough to do the trick, anyway, in terms of national mood damaging the film's success. But another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still doing very brisk holiday business. I haven't done the research into box office numbers, but I'd say that Dumbo's concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on Mr. Bug. Movie-going was at an all time high at this period, and successful films could go strong in theaters for months. -- Something unimaginable in these typically short-run, quick to-DVD days.\",\n",
       " b'While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it\\'s obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn\\'t waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.  Amongst the many inconsistencies:   * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests.   * Jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is not from St. Paul\\'s writings, neither is it in the Bible. I can\\'t even find it in the Gnostic scriptures.   * Jacob tells his bishop he doesn\\'t believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180 (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to possessed Isabelle. Sure, it\\'s possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest/psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic-turned-believer.   * Miguel, the former priest turned farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes scripture, and she quotes back. He says \"I see you know Psalm 65\" - she corrects him \"that\\'s Psalm 67\" - they\\'re both wrong.   * Miguel, the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, calling on the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells Jacob he doesn\\'t believe in church and he doesn\\'t believe in God. (Maybe he\\'s just conflicted?) Jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway.   * Miguel, the former ROMAN CATHOLIC priest, crosses himself backwards (or Eastern Orthodox-style). As an Hispanic Roman Catholic who USED to be a priest, he should\\'ve crossed himself forehead to sternum, left-side to right side of chest.  I had to read into the little side stories to get the notion Satan was messing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it\\'s pretty clear he was guilty).  On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot twist with Claire.  I\\'m just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof.  Listening to the running commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I\\'m inclined to believe it was a joke.',\n",

       " b'Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) shows up on the New York dockyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss Jack Warden. While there, he strikes up a friendship with black man Sydney Poitier that unfortunately leads to a gut-wrenching moral dilemma for a man who, we learn, typically runs from his problems.  The movie looks like Oscar winner On the Waterfront, feels like On the Waterfront, and most importantly, plays much like that 1954 Kazan production. However, its racial theme is ground-breaking for the time. The black Poitier and the white Cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect. It might even be called the first of the black-white \"buddy\" pictures that would later dominate so many action films.  It helps that the two leads play so well off each other. Nonetheless, the movie\\'s central flaw is failing to indicate why crew-boss Poitier pushes a friendship with the dour Cassavetes in the first place. He really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. But why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crew-boss Warden, but then comes to genuinely like the guy. There\\'s a hint of that in some of Cassavetes\\'s suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship appears unmotivated.  If there\\'s a single stage shot in the entire movie, I couldn\\'t spot it. Everything is done on seedy New York location, without the usual movie extras. In that sense, it\\'s an anti-Hollywood production, carefully deglamorized even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. I suppose sociologists would dub this rather raw slice-of-life \"a glimpse of the working poor\".  Yet, for all its virtues, which are many, the film remains too close to the Brando-Kazan movie for comfort. Here, a fine unknown actress Kathleen Maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend, Warden the role of the corrupt labor boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. Still and all, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a look-see.',\n",

Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year.  'Devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love, fate and destiny. I would keep away from it.

The comments on here surprise me, it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction.   The shock value is the least appealing thing about this film - a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion. The story is of Pierre's downfall - and the subsequent destruction of those around him - which is overtly demonstrated in his features, demeanour and idiolect. The dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other I have seen, and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic.  I can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching, as I did, with an open mind. You will, I hope, be rewarded in the same way that I was.

If she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty.   I went to the film expecting the depiction of an wretched girl who is crushed by society. This isn\\'t what \"Vanaja\" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. She won\\'t accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it\\'s never clear that she won\\'t succeed, despite the odds.   The acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as Mrs. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer.  In the film Vanaja learns South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I couldn\\'t tell how good Vanaja\\'s dancing was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. (Don\\'t think Bollywood--this is classical dance. It\\'s also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. In Sound Indian dance, the heel is the primary contact point.)  This is a movie that is not to be missed.

They don\\'t have much of any personality and I didn\\'t care for them much.  Some of the girls go on a camping trip for school. On the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang. The biker gang should really have been left out of the movie - it was cheesy before, but now it\\'s just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them.  I don\\'t really know what the heck happens after that. There\\'s a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it\\'s the end of the millennium, then some of the bikers get killed by a mysterious Indian dude who keeps disappearing. Somebody gets eaten by a cheesy Lock Ness Monster thing as he\\'s swimming across a lake. Some guy in silly makeup is apparently a Druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to forestall the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I\\'m afraid I wasn\\'t paying much attention. First he dresses the girls up in animal skin lingerie.  It could have been a really fun cheesy movie, but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so scatterbrained that it didn\\'t even live up to my grade Z schlock expectations. They really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things. Instead it\\'s all over the place. Overall, if you\\'re looking for late \\'80 schlock, I imagine you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There\\'s plenty of nudity at the beginning, but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying.',\n",
       " b\"Excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings proving once again that he could really act up a storm.  This time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant.  Priscilla Lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and he is pursued from California to N.Y.  There is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy 5th columnists to destroy from from within. Hitchcock was known to play up the upper echelons of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director.  Ironically, the film implodes at the very end. While we see what happens to the guy who killed Cummings' friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, again, many of whom represent the upper crust of society.\",\n",
       " b'It used to be that video distributors like Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would release low-budget, shot-on-video horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee. That\\'s acceptable to me, because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles.  Now we have Lions Gate getting into the mix, only they have decided that it\\'d be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a \"professional\" looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher-budget, professionally made features. Do not be suckered in by this! Granted, if you\\'ve seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside professionally-made features.  I am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget, shot-on-video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The \"acting\" (if you can call it that) was abysmal. It was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two, but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable. The story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. The only possible saving grace to this would be one disemboweling scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood splatters after a girl is slapped or the mannequin decapitation.  It took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and I only did so because I paid good money to rent it and felt like I should at least finish it all the way through. Stay away - stay far, far away from this one.',\n",
       " b\"I have heard an awful lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence.   I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence.   Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.\",\n",
       " b'I know...I know: it\\'s difficult (if not paradoxical) for there to be such a thing as \"believable\" fantasy. But, to me, there is also such a condition wherein TOO MUCH UNbelievability interfere\\'s with, or distracts from my overall opinion of the movie. The latter was the case for me with regard to Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline, but some of the acting, too, I thought, was a bit over-the-top. (Maybe, though, it was the writing: asking them to recite too many trite, predictable, cliched (over-?) reactions.) Others have said enough about the plot. I just wish that it was done - and, I think that it COULD have been - more convincingly. P. S.: This is a FRESH comment about this film - I just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago; not a recollection from years ago.',\n",
       " b\"I can never figure if this is the Artiest Soap Opera ever produced, or the Soapiest Art Movie. No matter, John Seale's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to film. If there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read. I do not like repeating adjectives, but ravishing serves the purpose.   Apart from the storyline, the players excel. But it is the Australian sense of light and shade that ultimately triumphs. Like some antipodean Dutch Master, Seale uses a blast of light, where Van Rijn would have used shade. One could weep for cinematography this magnificent.\",\n",
       " b'The Kite Runner began as one of those \"important\" films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly descended into an idiotic film of absurdly outlandish proportions.  I\\'ve never read the book, and never felt the need because I honestly don\\'t care. Sure I\\'m called uninformed for saying it but I truly have no interest whatsoever in just another \"pull at your heartstrings, copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers\" novel, even if it is set in Afghanistan.  That said, I watched the movie. I heard good things about its beauty, and how touching it was and decided why not? As it turns out, there was a very good reason why not. Not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic (I get it, he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible. I hated him and not in that good \\'Anti-hero\\' way, he was just a dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character that I felt nothing towards) but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that I couldn\\'t believe how everyone else was fawning over how beautiful it was, and how they cried and it moved them. I\\'m sorry, but I only feel moved by something that feels realistic, Sci-Fi has been known to move me, fantasy as well...but this? Please. This surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity! My biggest peeve, Hassan was Amir\\'s brother...really? You sure you didn\\'t just rip that off from a thousand other stories? Positive that that particular tidbit wasn\\'t just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences (y\\'know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie)? I was rolling my eyes when that \"twist\" was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there (not to mention flashing back to Star Wars \"Amir, Hassan is your brother\" \"NOOOoo, that\\'s not true, that\\'s IMPOSSIBLE!\") Oh, and it certainly did. Filled to the brim with clich\\xc3\\xa9\\'s and just plan dumb storytelling. Like \"good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you\". Ooh and don\\'t forget the oh so idiotic \"finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who, surprise surprise, has turned into a psychopathic adult\" (trust me guys, I understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that\\'ll never happen. You know that kid who teased you in high school...he\\'s no terrorist, he\\'s probably an accountant.)   Oh, and I must mention the CGI-tastic kites! I think those were on par with the \"Matrix\" movies and \"Transformers\" bravo you guys! BRAVO!  It seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the Middle East (hey an overly emotional friendship story will work!) This is one of the most shallow movies I\\'ve had the misfortune of seeing, it poses as deep well...but when you get right down to it, it\\'s nothing special.  Unfortunately, the core of America\\'s audience will do what they\\'re told and follow the \"It\\'s about controversial material so it must be good!\" way of thinking.',\n",

He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name. In spite of the romantic delusion and everything, Louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wife.  This film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal,deception, killing, theft and Hitchcockian suspense. Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as suspect heroine. The film gets several references to the American cinema, but Truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer, such as : Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart, and Hitchcock.The USA version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. Loosely based on the novel titled'Waltz into darkness' by Cornell Woolrich (Rear window and screenwriter of Alfred Hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in 'Truffaut's The bride wore black'.Colorful cinematography by Denys Clerval(Stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel, Truffaut's usual musician.This is one of the best of his suspense movies along with \\xc2\\xa8Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player\\xc2\\xa8.

Salvagers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. They're challenged by ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. This part sequel, part remake has Caine, Malden and ANOTHER group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board Caine's tug.  Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.\",\n",
       " b'Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" and \"Wrongfully Accused\"). So the fact that I\\'m slamming \"Mr. Magoo\" should show that it\\'s a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems like the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan\\'s movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn\\'t; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there\\'s no real humor here.  So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there\\'s no reason to waste your time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably don\\'t wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.',\n",
       " b'I watched this movie, having never read the book, and took the characters at face value, but having already been introduced to them, watched it again recently. I got a whole different viewpoint out of the film.  Without the burden of having to focus intently on each character, learning their quirks and foibles, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film. The farm families of Iowa are so intimately inter-related as they are in the area of Indiana where I grew up in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s that I immediately recognized the back-stories and motives behind the characters. Perhaps, Jane Smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live, but viewers are so caught up in the \"Hollywood\" aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes. Another film with these characteristics is the \"Bridges of Madison County\". Try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture.',\n",
       " b'Anyone who will pay to see Troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. Having said that, I didn\\'t think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. I found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end. First off, it\\'s an Indonesian action movie with an American main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of \"Taxi\"\\'s Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He puts posters of himself dressed up like Sly\\'s \"Cobra\" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of his greatest enemies)in Jakarta although he\\'s in the CIA and has just arrived days earlier. There is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the actors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. It involves the world\\'s most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a \"drug detector device\". Why would they need it? That is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? Makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. The actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to \"act\". Best line? \"Now dance to your grave you dirty whore!\" Best scene? Rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie\\'s hand, let\\'s go, falls, shoots helicopter as he\\'s falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. F**king genius! If you can\\'t appreciate trash, don\\'t watch it. If you can, it\\'s awesome. One last thing, did I mention it was directed by the three Punjabi brothers?',\n",
       " b'I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I attend was part of a community wide outreach to present God and Christianity to our community (Hartford, Ct. USA). I was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted...and to follow up on them after the movie. As such, it did what it was supposed to do, and I personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in God.I also found it to be very helpful to those I counseled. I especially like the work of Kim Darby in this movie. And the parents (the Wintons?) were , in a way, a little overdrawn....no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the Wintons did \"oh, no, no, not thaaat.\" That isn\\'t exactly what they said, but the sympaathetic audience I saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say, and also at the son\\'s emphatic \"No, MOm, not me.\" Don Berghuis',\n",
       " b'I was first introduced to this movie while in San Antonio, Tx. This movie was the 2nd. in a double feature. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was torn down. Anyways, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the U.S. the following year. Like a lot of \"other\" Kung-Fu movies released while riding on the \"coat-tails\" of Enter the Dragon, this particular movie actually was pretty good. It\\'s the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to better himself & his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the \"opponent\" martial arts school plans & scheme to thwart our hero, utilizing dirty tactics to try to throw him off track & try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. By surprise, I had thought since Warner Bros. distributed this movie in the U.S., Warner Bros. was going to issue a DVD. It never happened. As far as I know, this movie has been released in both English & Cantonise, w/sub-titles.....the latter a more \"cleaner & clearer\" version. Although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch (i.e.: flying in air & hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head....literally....to hit his opponent, etc.), nonetheless, it\\'s classic kung-fu action wonderfully planned & executed. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any Movie collection.....if you can find it.',\n",
       " b\"with what they had. John and Carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could.

The screenplay is very true to the book, which I was charmed by - this is a rarity in itself these days.

An intelligent and well crafted film.',\n",
       " b'**May Contain Spoilers**  The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced \"dee-SAYd\") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant \"Nubian\" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. De Sade\\'s crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (This scene was viewed on late-night TV by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) The one nearly-normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. (\"I used to be a nurse, now I\\'m not much of anything.\") She and Fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de Sade and Mantis combined.  \\tThis movie was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (I\\'ll say this much for Mr. Boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) It\\'s rather like an Andy Milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. The period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if Andy wasn\\'t called in as a consultant. However, Milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. Technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. Also, a film made in Texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. Fallon\\'s initial encounter with the leprous Countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie\\'s parting shot. If the rest had been half as harrowing, THE DUNGEON OF HARROW would have been a terror classic. Instead it\\'s a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons.',\n",
       " b'Very well done acting and directing. This is a cross between \"The Last Don\" and \" Godfather 2\".One large plus for this production is that it is claimed to be a true story of Joseph Bonanno. With a better music score to create mood, it could have been a rival for both Godfather movies.',\n",
       " b\"I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting. A true waste of time on DVD and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. If you watch this film, you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted.\",\n",
       " b\"Right, here we go, you have probably read in previous reviews on this film that it is awful, badly acted, avoid at all costs. Well i suppose in some ways this is true, it is fair to say that you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment as there is no plot to spoil. However, there is a fine line between plain awful and absolutely hilarious and believe me this film is the latter. The acting is so bad, the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through. There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it is worth every penny.\",\n",
       " b\"I caught this movie on late-night TV. Honestly i saw most of it, and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief.  Is there any genre that's more pointless than soft-core porn? If there is i don't want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (lousy production values, abominable acting, crappy scripts) with the coyness of sex-scenes in regular movies. So the end result is arousing nor entertaining. This movie also has the rather odd approach of a science-fiction setting, and it works horribly. All the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love. And yes, it's about as confused and silly as it sounds.  But there has to be some positive points though, right? Well, there is one... Krista Allen is amazingly hot. That's about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie. I don't know what it is about her, but she has an amazing sex appeal. The rest of the cast look like the standard porn-cast though. Rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts, and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany as well judging by haircuts and clothing.  To sum things up. If you enjoy Krista Allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential (most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though). If you don't enjoy Krista Allen then you might as well stay away altogether.  I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allens sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn/science fiction hybrid that's not really like anything i've ever seen.\",\n",
       " b'If you\\'re a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.  I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the \"bad grrl\" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.  You wouldn\\'t have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and same for every character that dies in this movie.  The selfish,twisted,perverted, dominating personas of Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. In the end they literally develop into a cutesy couple ala Annie Hall. The only character who remained true to the show was the Relicle, the floating machine in the sky. I suppose if you ever thought \"gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it were more like every other faceless good-v-evil sci-fi Hollywood slop out there\", then you are in for a treat.  They didn\\'t even get the look right. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole setting is wrong. 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past. Instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer\\'s eyes are offended with a 70\\'s mod-squad frutopia of egg-shaped furniture, wood paneled walls, earth tones, and lots of plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia.  Speaking of Bregna, that\\'s the only city on earth according to the movie. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the movie, the \"Monicans\" are just Hollywood storybook freedom-fighters. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case from the show.  The only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio execs, and he\\'s never seen an entire Aeon Flux all the way through. The overwhelming amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is baffling. Beyond using certain names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild, and Bregna, the movie is nothing like the show.  The actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of soy-lent green, blade runner, Logan\\'s run, and tomb raider, which came out a dull brown mess.',\n",
       " b\"In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.  With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).  It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.\",\n",
       " b'The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (\"The Antichrist\", \"The Killer is on the Phone\") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests\\xc2\\x85), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and \\xc2\\x96 last but not least \\xc2\\x96 a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy? When the anonymous man, dressed up like a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs, it really sent cold shivers through my spine! Years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded. She \\xc2\\x96 Joanna \\xc2\\x96 falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away. Naturally, he\\'s only after her money and starts terrorizing Joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her. The repeated images of a sinister looking priest, guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme, provide \"Formula for a Murder\" with a ton of genuine scares and Alberto De Martino\\'s directing is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck (\"The Beyond\", \"The Black Cat\") in a glorious greedy villain role. Due some plot holes and a lack of originality, this movie might not be able to compete with Italy\\'s best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many formerly obscure and unknown Italian gialli received marvelous DVD-releases and, hopefully, \"Formula for a Murder\" will be given the same treatment really soon. In the meantime, good luck tracking this baby down!',\n",
       " b'John Huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement,and it\\'s thoroughly his testament:uncompromising,difficult ,a thousand miles away from crazes and fashions,it will stand as the best \"last film\" you can ever dream of.A very austere screenplay,no action,no real hero,but a group of people coping with the vanity of life,the fleeting years and death.The party doesn\\'t delude people for long.Admittedly,warmth and affection emanate from the songs and the meal,complete with turkey and pudding.But the passage of time has partly ruined Julia\\'s voice,first crack in the mirror.Then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the old lady\\'s bedroom.For sure,hers seems to have been a happy life,but it\\'s a life inexorably coming to an end-A shot shows towards the end of the movie Julia on her future deathbed-.Maybe an unfulfilled life,because she remained a spinster,with no children to carry on .Only some poor things,yellowish photographs,bibelots and trinklets.... But are a human being\\'s hopes and dreams all fulfilled?Look at Gretta.She \\'s a married woman ,about thirty-five,she\\'s still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken.What Julia is today,she will be tomorrow,that\\'s why,in her stream of consciousness,she goes back to her past,only to find out how harrowing her memories are: a young man committed suicide for her,a symbol of her youth now waning.The final monologue,if we listen closely to it,involves us all in this eternal tragedy,the doomed to failure human condition,John Huston\\'s masterly lesson.',\n",

I didn't laugh once - a very unfunny flick - and I usually love Reiner. I cannot for the life of me figure why this is seen as funny. I had not one chuckle. And I love comedies! Oh well, at least now I know what all the shouting was about. Not my idea of a comedy. Go rent The Navigator or The Love Nest by Buster Keaton - now THOSE are comedy classics! If you rent this one - have a back-up rental so your whole evening isn't a loss. Score 3 out of 10\",\n",

I believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life, one of joy and indulgence, I heartily recommend it!  The performance is excellent, and the music uplifting!',\n",
       " b'I think that this is a fabulous movie... I watched it constantly from the time I was 4 to about the time I was 8... However, watching it resulted in many nightmares. I particularly got them because of the guy that was always like \"the otherworld\" and his friends. I am 12, and I still get nightmares about it to this day. I can\\'t fall asleep right now because I am thinking about it. I love this movie, but it is so scary! I definitely love this movie though, I have very good memories from it. Kate is very good at acting in this movie. Amazingly, I never realized that it was her! I also think that the graphics were very high quality, contrary to what some other people think',\n",
       " b\"Historical drama is one of the areas where the British just can't be beat. So while i'm not a huge fan of the genre, i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's British and with decent actors.  I have never read anything by Sarah Waters, which is of course something i should do. Hence i didn't really know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story, but not much more. While watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated. Without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. Although there were almost a twist too many somewhere, it took me a minute to get everything straight.  Production values are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour. That might just be me though, i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished. All in all though, this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.\",\n",
       " b\"Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside clich\\xc3\\xa9-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn't mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.  B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.\",\n",
       " b'This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen (not including anything by or with Pauly Shore). I couldn\\'t believe that a film could actually be THIS bad!  Coolio has to be the single worst actor (again, not including Pauly Shore) to ever \"star\" in a movie. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR, I would have been inclined to press that).  Do yourself a favor, and do something more interesting than watch this movie, like watching the grass grow, or watching golf on TV.',\n",
       " b\"The first in a new style of films for Lamas- no tattoo's, motorcycles or karate. I, for one, miss them. But this is a serious movie. He plays a FBI profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is either a great actor or somebody I wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending. It seems to never come - there is always one more layer to the story. Cloke and Lamas start out as the good guys, turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes. But it's definitely worth the rental price. For maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar,a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You're going to the MOVIES!\",\n",
       " b\"I saw this short film on the dvd for Ridley Scott's film, The Duellists. There was no introduction by Scott before the film, it just started right up.   Boy and a Bicycle is hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it bears no resemblance. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, riding around on a bicycle. Guess what? That's pretty all that happens. The boy rides around, rambling on and on with pointless, confusing dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by Ridley Scott, I expected some cool cinematography or visually-striking sets. Instead, I was treated with nothing. This film isn't even good for a first effort. However, I recommend that any fan of Ridley Scott should check it out at least once.\",\n",
       " b'In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, \"Rabbit Seasoning\" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).  I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqu\\xc3\\xa9 for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did. All in all, this just goes to show what geniuses the people behind these cartoons were.',\n",
       " b\"I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into. I did think that Jodie looked great throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason I watched the entire thing. Maybe parading Jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made. I saw a TV biography of Jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order, and this movie was the only one never mentioned. After seeing it, I can now see why.\",\n",
       " b'\"War is in your blood\" Rambo says early in the film, \"don\\'t fight it\". Say, what? Is the scriptwriter taking the Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here. Yet, Stallone utters it without a hint of irony.  The same lack of humour applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an over-the-top, idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren\\'t sickeningly violent. A redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous, it is not enough just to kill them \\xc2\\x96 you have to dismember them with relish. Stallone stops at no blue-collar clich\\xc3\\xa9 to make his point. It is not enough for the chief villain to be feed-them-to-the-pigs, throw-babies-into-fire kind of sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual.  What is happening to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but this is not entertainment \\xc2\\x96 this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn\\'t take his shirt off. For this I will give it one star...',\n",
       " b\"Prince of Central Park (2000) is so utterly bad. It was a pure waste of my time and I can't believe I actually watched the whole thing. Please do not watch this movie, if it's the last thing you do!\",\n",
       " b\"Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.  But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.  Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.  In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.  The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.\",\n",
       " b'I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it!! It was so hilarious I have seen it too many times to count. I love the Stork brothers and the pitiful, ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote form the movie is, \"It\\'s so ugly, it should be put to sleep.\" I also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick that way. I love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie too. They were great. This movie brings back memories of my college days when I first saw it. I rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over. My college roommate and I just couldn\\'t get enough of it.Who couldn\\'t love this crazy movie?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?',\n",
       " b'Where do I begin, its one of the most frustrating movies I\\'ve seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though, if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day, a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things, so far everything\\'s normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy, why didn\\'t they bring or buy a g*d damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn\\'t open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they\\'re bring tortured or tied up.(one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up, the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.  Well if you\\'ve read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN\\'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously, they never said anything about the actual house being haunted, just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That\\'s why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol \"oh lets give this place a chance honey\" scheme going, so props to that. Still though, me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn\\'t they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.  All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot (to an extent) but the solution is so simple you\\'re scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can\\'t shoot her like that.  4 out of 10 (a low budget porno The Man Show would love)',\n",
       " b\"Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. He stars as David Holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death.  Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. The pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar Dickensian narrative. However, examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it's a very daring and unique film. Audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure.  Watching the film, it's easy to see the later influences this film had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are here on full display. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.\",\n",
       " b\"My 2nd favorite film of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally dismissed by a lot of idiots, calling in an audience-baiting piece of trash. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as the hard-assed working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation. He's a frightening dude, but has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a teenage liberal when this was released, but as horrifying as Joe seemed to me, he also cracked me up! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and a mixed-up stone rich fox. The dinner scene in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved.  This WAS NOT an exploitation film and the script (which was Oscar-nominated) should have won that year. The director just didn't WASTE enough money making it to give it enough credibility in Hollywood. No matter your political pursuasion, then and now, you'll like somebody in this film. A definite 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check it out!\",\n",
       " b\"I went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line. I understand that changes between written works and movies must be made...for many reasons.  The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office.  Ron Howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.  At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job\",\n",
       " b\"This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.  And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.  Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.\",\n",
       " b\"This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.  I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.  The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap. Though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna.  This film is so dreadful, it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I took it back, of people demanding their money back. I kid you not!\",\n",
       " b\"I blow hot and cold over Carn\\xc3\\xa9. He really can be a puzzle for me. I think perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. Certainly a man who came to maturity in the Thirties with the Popular Front seems ill at ease in the France of the Fifties, with its rampant commercialism and heavy American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. The party scenes go on much longer than they should, as if he were trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. Roland Lesaffre's character--he plays Pascale Petit's older brother--seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-style ideas are still sound.  At two hours, this picture is far too long. Still, let me praise Pascale Petit for her game performance; she was a natural who should have challenged Brigitte Bardot for sexpot supremacy, but somehow lost her way. Andrea Parisy is excellent too as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the Fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who could play an anarchist convincingly: he is great here as he rescues a cat from death, then remarks he can't stand cats. Jacques Charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little grin and those blank eyes.\",\n",
       " b'The whole exercise is pointless. Why make the film at all? The lighting is ghastly, but the sound is just a joke. Like a high-school production. Whoever put the budget together for this film should be drawn and quartered for allowing it to be made without the proper budget for soundmen with equipment fit for recording.  So much dialog is unintelligible due to losses in echo or the lack of proximity to the mic. Economy should have been made on any other area. The whole production is lifeless and just LAME with such amateurish half-arsed production. It lacks warmth, clarity, and has no design to it.',\n",
       " b\"Watched this piece ONDEMAND because the description was kind of outlandish. This film stinks of cocaine, the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in blow to film. This is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that plods along for a good 1hr and 22mins with absolutely no direction. I am a little confused on how this has good reviews here. I won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as I can tell there is no plot. I'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set everyday did giant lines, dressed Loretta Switt in plunging necklines to show as much flapjack breastage as possible and yelled action; letting the cast improvise in a cocaine frenzy. Much like real beer this movie nearly caused my liver to fail half way through. Save your money, and watch 'Strange Brew' instead.\",\n",
       " b\"Very disturbing, but expertly crafted & scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis, and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story centers around a young boy (Bryan Madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist (Dennis) to get involved. It is a gruesome cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll love this. If you don't like Parents, stay away from the film. Just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters.  Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence.\",\n",
       " b'Since Jason and his ilk took over horror films circa 1980 most every horror film has involved a group of hormonally charged teenagers being chopped to bits with the focus on the chopping and not the suspense.  This little film is different. Made in the early 80\\'s it does what every good horror film should do - bring your worst fears to life while you sit around just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. Then, you make those horrors simmer, just don\\'t turn it into a lesson on the biology of butchering.  The story features Meg Tilly right before she had a short-lived turn with fame starting with \"The Big Chill\" and then slipped back into obscurity in the early 90\\'s. Meg plays an outcast teenager who is just dying to get into the good graces of some classic mean girls. They tell her she can be part of their little group if she spends the night in a crypt. The mean girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt thus giving them a double reward - further tormenting the outcast girl and having an excuse to reject her.  Meanwhile famed occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died a bizarre death shortly after having claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and upon his return command great magical powers. His daughter doesn\\'t believe this at first, but she listens to a tape about her father\\'s experiments which included his successful animation of small dead animals and of his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate bigger game and draw further power from these animations. She also learns that she may have inherited her father\\'s power and may be the only person who can stop him should he actually rise from the dead. I think you know where this story is headed, so I\\'ll stop here. Did I mention the magician was entombed in the same crypt in which Meg Tilly\\'s character is spending the night?  I will mention that the commercial DVD containing this film does look somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect from a film that was made so recently. I saw it on TV in the mid 1980\\'s and I remember it looking better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means it comes complete with dirt and scratches.  This is worth checking out for any horror fan. It was an independently made film and an example of the kind of unusual stuff that you could commonly find on late night TV until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast wasteland circa 1986. Only TCM Underground airs this kind of film anymore.',\n",
       " b'Well, I have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film. Natalie Portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film.   Beautiful film.',\n",
       " b\"I truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes, but this one is completely different - it's simply brilliant. Plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great.  I've seen it at least dozen times and still I'm not tired with the plot, characters or music (I just love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack that I've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that I owe).  For me it's a must-seen kind of movie, great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end.\",\n",
       " b'This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely poor rip-off of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore-mentioned rogue cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called \"Shape of things\", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don\\'t think so.',\n",
       " b'There were two things I hated about WASTED : The directing and the script . I know I`m opening myself up to ridicule but Stephen T Kay`s direction is too much like a .... like a .... well like a MTV pop video . It`s shot ( I think ) on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack , often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting . If you`re not a teenager you`ll find many segments of WASTED unwatchable due to the stylistic approach . As bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain . The story is told through Samantha , a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over ( Strange how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character ) telling us of the pressure of her exams , the pressure of home life , her social solitude and it`s all this that led her to take drugs . It`s for similar reasons like parental break up that her two male friends ( I thought she was supposed to be lonely ? ) to start taking drugs . Oh poor little Sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart bled for you and your chums - NOT . What WASTED doesn`t mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to , be it drink , drugs , nicotine or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict , they`re not a victim of external forces , they`re commiting an act of free will . Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING made this point very well , people become addicts because they want to . To portray them as victims in any way is wrong patronising and very possibly dangerous  By the way , if MTV are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit taking drugs ?',\n",
       " b\"With a cheap pound shop having just opened,i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap DVDs that looked good.and while the back of the cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers type of film,it is actually an anthology film! and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar.Its still a fun light horror/comedy. The plots:  Story one:The classic.  A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $1500 car.But,when the guy goes to pick a car,a car starts to talk to him.The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life,that he must buy Baans for $5000.So while the guys relationship crumbles,Baans does everything he can to show who really is in charge.  Story two:Kitchen culture.  A guy that might get thrown out by his land lord,due to how messy his flat is,discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months,the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!.And while they start off as friends,they end up having a big falling out,the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive.  Story three:Too good to be true.  A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her.But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect,and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked. View on the film:  The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england,where it has been given an eighteen rating,even thought it has no nudity,swearing or blood at all.And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings,where the goodies win!.And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine,the second story is easily the highlight of the film,with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!.  Final view on the film  While it does have a bit of a 'remake; feel,their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.\",\n",
       " b\"I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that ren\\xc3\\xa9e zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock \\xc3\\xa0nd ren\\xc3\\xa9e zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track. Many soap-opera-lovers will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character!!! - but they can bring all there non-soap friends, 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for the cruel scenes, the thriller-aspects and for the beautiful pictures. And I'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm!!!\",\n",
       " b'The best thing -- and that\\'s pretty good -- about The Black Castle is that it\\'s a black-and- white Forties\\' Gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952. The star ostensibly is the British actor Richard Greene, a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a mad count played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job except when he\\'s called on to laugh maniacally. Skulking around in the shadows is a long-gowned Boris Karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero.   It\\'s the middle of the 18th Century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to Count Karl von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von Bruno\\'s in Africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory. The Count was left not only with failure, but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye. von Bruno vowed revenge, and it seems he might have been partially successful. So under a false name, Sir Ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the Count, and off we go by carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the Count\\'s castle. It\\'s a hulking mass of stone turrets and corridors, shadowy stairways, huge fireplaces...and creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells, a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping, thrashing crocodiles. It also is filled by the Count\\'s lovely, blond, sensitive wife, Elga (Paula Corday, who sometimes is billed as Rita Corday), and by the Count\\'s two close friends played by those two actors we know from the Fifties who specialized in being slime in costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, knuckling servants, wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Not the least, Doctor Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred. The risk is that...well, when the person awakes ten hours later, he\\'d better hope he\\'s not already nailed shut in his coffin.   Surprisingly, for all the clich\\xc3\\xa9s, The Black Castle keeps moving merrily along. The movie takes itself seriously, but it\\'s competently enough made to keep our interest, even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch. It\\'s even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of The Most Dangerous Game. When Burton realizes just how crazy von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring von Bruno to accounts. And, naturally, he has fallen for Elga. von Bruno, crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable, is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged by the kill. Hollywood\\'s second creative rule has always been, \"If you\\'re going to steal, steal from the best.\" It\\'s first creative rule, of course, is \"If you\\'re going to steal, steal from the best and then turn it into liverwurst.\" The Black Castle is a nice bite of Austrian braunschweiger.',\n",

       " b'It is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. However, this is a dreadful film. Gene Hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as \"Gene Hackman\". Otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. Patrick Swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things, for which he must be eternally thankful.  I watched this film, as a result of someone else\\'s review and I felt that another point of view was merited. You may not agree with my review but now, at least, you have been warned.',\n",
       " b'Significant Spoilers!   This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don\\'t even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.  I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. She looks, speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs, who spent 20 years doing hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the DVD special features section of \"Surveillance: The Watched are Watching.\" You can see and hear her for yourself. She was every bit as bad as I had envisioned from the writing of this movie.  I\\'m not shocked by bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. The level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was seeking. This is a snuff film.  Be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. This director/writer is truly a sick person. I can\\'t believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. You can be assured that I will never, ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I have watched and collected, there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone I have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. There have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to her sick, twisted mind.  When I saw this movie, which was just one murder rampage after another. Once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.  As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my actual thoughts as I watched this movie. I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. On the DVD, she was indeed the sick, twisted person I had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.  While the little girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, truly stole the show... I can\\'t believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed, director to be anywhere near their daughter.  This movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.  As far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending, should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. I\\'m stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.  Other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you watch it carefully, even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I\\'m not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian town in the Special Features section of the DVD.  This writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. The only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in every character. Then listen to the director-writer talk on the DVD Special Features section and you will understand what I\\'m telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. She wouldn\\'t be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a Hollywood film making family.  Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. Since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles, I don\\'t think we\\'ll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad, director David Lynch helps her out. I\\'d recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and I\\'m not too sure her dad\\'s films would be any better.  Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.',\n",
       " b\"Predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.  But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.  I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (Not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go to dinner?)  Enough of this - I'm only on a rant because I was looking forward to this film. Rent THE LONGEST YARD instead.  \",\n",
       " b\"Affable aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best buddy George (the deliciously deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops, George, and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the mean Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the fetching Cookie, Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as cranky Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as smug preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak as hulking biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.\",\n",
       " b'\"Death Machines\" takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss\\' opponents) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. I have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget, bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called \"movie\". It\\'s easily the worst martial-arts/action oriented movie I\\'ve seen in years, eclipsing even \"Ninja Holocaust\" (which at least had some good energetic fight scenes).   The actual \"star\" of the movie is the white \"Death Machine\", (it\\'s basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He\\'s in good shape, and he\\'s not bad looking, but as an actor he\\'s barely there - think Chuck Norris in \"The Octagon\",only without any energy or emotion.This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...but you have to be Arnold to pull this kind of thing off, and this guy is no Arnold.  The movie (and the director) can\\'t seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed, like: Who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed Asian lady her orders? How did the \"gang war\" end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? And what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick?   It does, however, find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn\\'t work. It\\'s only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also K.O.\\'s the movie\\'s \"hero\", a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the \"Death Machines\" first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). It follows this up with one of the most un-called for \"love scenes\" between the hero and his girlfriend I have ever watched. The segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar-fight, she\\'s grimacing over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a \"tasteful\" shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a Hallmark card. BTW, we never see the sailor again.   And wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station, but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked.   The movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. The three \"Death Machines\" come across as clods; the \"hero\" knows his lines but can\\'t carry the movie, given that his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other minor parts are barely watchable. All this makes for a fairly poor movie- but the \"dragon lady\" does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else. She looks ridiculous; her tiny, inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she talks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that screams \"needed time with a dialog coach\". Poor lady - she was obviously way out of her element, and as far as I know, never appeared in a film again.   Add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one lame movie.   I got this as part of a 50 movie DVD compilation, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It wasn\\'t worth it. Feh!',\n",
       " b'Starting where the last AVP left off, an Alien \"chestburster\" emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship, and causes the Predator space ship to crash into modern day Gunnison Colorado, where it breeds several more Aliens which start to cause havoc. The Predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed Predator to \"clean up the mess\". Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.  The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. This movie moves along way too fast. The opening credits have only just rolled and already the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien grows to full hight, a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed, then we see the Predator home-world and the lead Predator flies off to fight the Alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie; the National Guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face, the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. One moment our main characters are at home, the next running around town, the next in a gun store , the next in an APC, and this random set jumping over and over just doesn\\'t ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.  Another problem is the settings and time frame. The movie is set in modern day Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator movie was shot in enthralling settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest\\'s, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. Now comes along AVP-R, set in a small modern day American town, with set \"highlights\" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, Pizza Shops, and little girl\\'s bedrooms. I mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull, drab and uninteresting as possible?! It\\'s hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.  Continuity is a big issue with this film. The Alien series was set in the future, no human had even heard of an Alien before the first film, and the Aliens not only had never been to Earth, but if they ever did reach Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day, with Average Joes seeing the Aliens all over the place, and by the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. It pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machina\\'s. The Predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that\\'s just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the Aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.  Also, for a \"Verses\" movie, it has unrelenting bias in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film, a lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of Aliens, all at m\\xc3\\xaal\\xc3\\xa9e range while barely gaining a single scratch, while the Aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons, merely waiting their turn to be killed by the Predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. This movie should not be called \"Alien vs. Predator\", as much as it should be \"Predator massacres Aliens\". I mean, how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other?   The characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous Alien and Predator movies, but even as a stand alone movie they are bland, dreary, and even at times cringe worthy. The characters in this movie consist of I kid you not, horny couples wanting to get laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off Ripley and Newt; the worst and most clich\\xc3\\xa9 possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. While the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher-porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance, with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. Not only this, but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as using Predator guns, commenting the powers out when it has been for hours, following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.  In the end this movie is just a horrible B movie, something deserving of the direct to DVD category. The fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.',\n",
       " b'Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress, and I\\'ve really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic \"She\\'s the Man.\" For that reason alone, \"Sydney White\" was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teen comedy, its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters. In \"Sydney White,\" this idea is thrown out the window.  Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney, but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress. I blame this on the script, which makes her character too bland and restrained, and on the hair/makeup department, which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style. The seven \"dorks\" that Sydney eventually befriends are far worse. They are so dorky that it\\'s impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They\\'re essentially repulsive gag fodder. As is the story\\'s \"Prince Charming,\" who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.  Perhaps the film\\'s biggest star-to-be (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who\\'s actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn. It\\'s just a shame that the script-writers didn\\'t make her a bit more gray than black.  The plot is basically that of \"Snow White.\" What kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining. The connections to \"Snow White\" are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the \"witch\" is far too despicably witchy, the seven \"dorks\" are too dorky, and Sydney is just too pure of heart. Now, this is not to say that the movie is all bad. Though Bynes is forced down by the script, she still has her moments. As does Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. Sydney\\'s room-mate, named \"Dinky\" is also great fun as a character. It\\'s a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clich\\xc3\\xa9d to recommend.',\n",
       " b'Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldn\\'t help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the \"performers\" featured here. Stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation all right--she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though, it has to be said, her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young, would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices you\\'ll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get in front of Morrissey\\'s camera anyway. There probably isn\\'t a worse way to spend a Saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life.',\n",
       " b'\"The Last American Virgin\", along with \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" is one the last great teen films ever made. It is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. Much-maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric, banal attempt to recreate the magic of \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\", these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late 1981, and released at only slight intervals from one another. Either way, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity. Especially considering the heart-wrenching discovery the protagonist, Gary is confronted with in the end. American Pie this is not. The story revolves around a trio of male teenagers, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary lusts after Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen begin having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him. Gary glides into help Karen, which leads to the aforementioned, unexpected conclusion. Overall as a film, I find it was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago. Also, it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made!!!',\n",
       " b\"Other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time. If not for Jason Lee's unjustifiable success in film, this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead.   The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. Is it funny? periodically but not consistently. Is it stupid? Each and every single episode.   I've seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than I ever could have imagined. The dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes. Every episode for someone with an IQ over 100 is an absolute struggle. And the icing on the cake? Jason Lee's annoying voice narrating each episode. If it weren't for the state's Southern culture and rednecks of the south, this show wouldn't have an audience.  If you're a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste, bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at life...well then you're probably an actor on this show.\",\n",

In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy. I\\'ve seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire.   This is a self-proclaimed \"zombie western\", but about the only thing that makes this a \"zombie western\" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actor\\'s real name is Clint. The protagonist isn\\'t cool and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero, he doesn\\'t have the wise-cracking attitude to pull it off either.  Don\\'t be fooled by the fake glowing reviews. This is just another B-grade zombie movie that\\'s competently made for the budget it had (it does have some decent lighting), but it reeks of low-budget, first-time directing and bad acting.

       " b'A mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb, not so horny teens who discover an evil video game (GASP) is killing those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the sustained mystery of the Mystery Gang in \"Scooby Doo\". I was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains. I could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci-fi but going all the way to the theaters, come on people. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of crummy two-but director Uwe Boll, since this would be his cast. As always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. I\\'d suggest using that mid-viewing. *1/2',\n",
       " b\"Too fractured to be enjoyable, too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making. Like a Ken Russell film at its worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by amateurs, MR LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday to somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the film maker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) quirky and deliberately off kilter. It ends up being annoying and indulgent.. and pointless. What's the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this film about Hollywood delusion. Maybe Korine wanted to remake GODSPELL ... well the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from FITZCARRALDO including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy, add James Fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring (like in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. It might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.\",\n",
       " b\"I wanted to love this film so badly...I really did. But it was a horrible disappointment.  I read Jennifer Egan's novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story. In fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Mind you, the book had much more depth than this movie, in plot and emotional resonance. It MADE you care about the characters. It painted a complete picture of Phoebe, unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the film.  Though beautiful and showing *some* promise in her burgeoning career, Jordana Brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just an awful choice for the role of Wolf, both physically and logistically. What an awkward looking couple. Wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character, and more physically alluring, like he was in the book. What's more, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced.  Cameron Diaz, however, deserves utmost praise for her performance. She took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life, a real spirit. She is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie. It's too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable film.  In the book-to-movie category, this is a dreadful translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But don't get me started on that one...  I am not usually so harsh in my critiques but I was so disappointed here, because I really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right. It did not deliver...  \",\n",

To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like \"The West Wing\" or \"Commander-in-Chief.\" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn\\'t act (he was awful in \"Early Edition\"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With its lack of suspense, urgency, and characters who can actually act, I just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so I would have nothing more to miss.  Grade D-',\n",

You know the kind, the memories that never leave you. Eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as Doug McClure and Peter Cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species\\'. And guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of Caroline Munro and her heaving cleavage. No wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.  Yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. And yes, Cushing and a surprisingly pudgy McClure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil Meyhas at the \"core\" of our film. But it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, At The Earth\\'s Core is a throwback to a special pre-ILM time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10',\n",

I recently saw Very Annie Mary, which I thought was very good. But Plots with a View is not only quirky, it's laugh out loud funny, has a cast of wonderfully talented actors (Brenda Blethyn is amazing), and a plot that, while not entirely original, is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines. It was the kind of movie that I wanted to watch again immediately it was over, and one of very few that I would actually like to own. Even though many of the characters are caricatures, and you have to have been to a Welsh village to appreciate that, they are also very human, and the rapport between Blethyn and Molina is a joy to behold.\",\n",

All \"This is a spoof\" musings aside, and while I certainly have tried to give it due consideration, have left me with a certain notion, namely; \"This is quite possibly the worst film ever made.\" On any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement... Seriously, I tried, I\\'m just as in to any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film as the next buff, but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls...

There\\'s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.  18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It\\'s clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his \"nine inning\" concept. It\\'s not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. Isn\\'t baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he\\'s sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the series\\' theme song, and manages to play \"Take Me Out To The Ballgame\" so many times you might vomit. We get it, dude.  Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls head over heels in love with Buck O\\'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly O\\'Neil waxes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense...  Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. \"Baseball\" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There\\'s no crying in baseball.',\n",
       " b\"I remember seeing this at my local Blockbuster and picked it up cause I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on half-caste, a half-human half-leopard creature that preys on the people of Africa.  The movie is horrendous! The actors are terrible! There is no script whatsoever! It's all improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it. It's obvious bull*bleep*! They film at night to make it scary. But, they have failed to scare me. After the first person was killed, I put this back in the case and took it back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  Now you are probably saying I have no right to review a movie if I haven't finished it. Well, this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through.  1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!\",\n",

Get some popcorn and have a great time.\",\n",
       " b\"Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. This film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems targeted at children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent go to such a waste, after her classic performance in I, Claudius.\",\n",
       " b\"Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...  This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.  The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. The people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven. No reason to repent if its aliens. The deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.\",\n",

       " b\"I'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about a 20 minutes to go. If it gets any better, I will come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt that will happen. Solomon Kane looks like it is based on the video game Dark Watch, and it sounds like it is based on the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately neither is true. I hear it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that I have never heard of, but whatever it is based on, there is nothing original in this excruciatingly boring movie. The atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300, which wasn't that great in the first place. The tedious overacting takes itself so seriously that it's nearly hypnotic, and to be clear I mean that in a bad way. The plot is practically non-existent: violent guy trying to be nonviolent meets friendly family, friendly family is murdered, violent guy becomes violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes or, whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash wizardry movie that you have seen and there you have it. Someone, somewhere, said, this is how to make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add plenty of slow motion shots of horse hooves splashing in murky puddles, add snowflakes hovering around while two boring characters are speaking to each other, and oh yes rain pouring down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and don't forget the black silhouettes walking toward us with fire blazing behind them, and lots of torches burning, and of course blurry fight scenes during which it's not clear what is actually happening because we don't have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal clanking, and, oh, by the way, don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross fingers, hope that fans of sword and sorcery films will eat it up, even though it is complete doo doo, and go straight to video, do not pass GO . . .\",\n",
       " b'I loved this movie and I watch it everyday. I think that although the acting isn\\'t all that great, it\\'s really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. I had been looking all over for this movie, for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it. It is now, by far my favorite movie of all time. It deals with relationship failure, and at the same time making a joke of it. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for a grape when they\\'re sitting on the porch, and He tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch. IT really portrays him as he really is. The part in the \"Making Of\" really touched me, when they adressed Brandon Novak\\'s addiction to heroin, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new movie that\\'s in the making, called \"Dreamseller,\" is in production, which is about the story of Novak\\'s dreams, shattered by his addiction.',\n",
       " b\"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   Unorthodox journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) flits away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. But everything changes when the landlady of the Thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As he digs deeper into both mysteries, he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for.  In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Okay, no one was blown away by his acting ability, but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. But it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to DVD hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but here he is.  A script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking Jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. Jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and Dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. Add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression.  What exactly did I expect with something that came free with The Daily Mail? *\",\n",

The film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from Govinda who has become a legend within Indian Cinema and will always bring his A game in terms of comedies. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics 'Don', an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Dutta is a plus...I know I sound shallow but its mainly because I have a soft spot for her, she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced. Her acting is weak...but she still shines. Salman Khan is atrocious, he tries to bring the cool, charming depths but fails miserably, he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason.   'Thats not acting mate, thats called being mentally challenged'  Katrina Kaif is just bad...not very good at anything. No charisma, no talent..and I don't see why people consider her pretty... The plot was far fetched and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was remotely attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is the music...'You're my love' was the best in the soundtrack.\",\n",

Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test. This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists (if any exist).  Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules:   1. If you don't have the budget for real special effects, rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. It will look great - trust me.  2. When on a quest to recover Zeus' thunderbolts, take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions.  3. Any sword fight, use of magic, and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids.  4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars.  5. If you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music. It also helps if you've got a previous movie to pull scenes from.  6. Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time.  7. William Berger did anything for money.  8. I didn't think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film, Hercules (1983), look like an Academy Award winner.\",\n",

I played plenty of good and bad games and I think this game has the dullest story I was ever forced to listen. The best thing they could have done is to let you skip the conversations (but no, you must listen to them talking for 10 minutes) and just continue doing the same things over and over again. Climb the building, save the citizen, go kill some dude. IT'S ALL THE SAME! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination.  I'm a huge fan of Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time. I don't even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for Assassin's Creed should be banned to write another thing for the rest of his life.  Boring story and same missions over and over again! If just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing.\",\n",

As a fan of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", where Jeff was pretty much the straight guy role, I was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal.  Much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on poignancy, which I really liked, rather than being slapstick or over-explained. And there were some nice little surprises and twists. The convenience store vignettes were a delight.  When I say it is a wonderful \"small\" film, I don\\'t mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and hand-crafted. It tells a highly believable everyday story. Relax and go see it. Let it wash over you, and you will feel good for having done so.',\n",

It\\'s not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word \\'isten\\' means \\'god\\' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ?   Let\\'s consider this movie as \\'A History Of Violence\\' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and \\'none FX-ed as hell\\' science fiction in the one we\\'re looking at right now. Everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : The nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote \"In The Days of Perky Pat\") by creating a \\'Perky Pat\\' fast-food restaurant. The nod to Stanley Kubrick by using 2001\\'s naming pattern ; as IBM became HAL (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in eXistenZ \\'classic lubricant spray\\' WD-40 becomes XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra cleans up Pikul\\'s port. The nod to David Cronenberg by using Videodrome\\'s witty kind of formula (\\'Death to...\\' & \\'Long Live\\'..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in Videodrome, Video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you penetrated a TV set. In 1999, you\\'re penetrated by a game. Welcome to Canada!)  The nod to good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky\\'s cinematography, Howard Shore\\'s music and Ronald Sanders\\'s editing (a team that wins). For everyone born in the early 80\\'s with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. Enough with the nods. The plot ? \"Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players\\' minds\" as we can see on the movie main details page. That\\'s the story in the story. To me, this picture is about a \\'reality demonstrators\\' young couple infiltrating the \\'brand new virtual game\\' presentation session to destroy its programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there\\'s such thing as reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they\\'re in and the end of the movie IS the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, \\'Cronenbergy realistic\\' plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there\\'s a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays eXistenZ\\'s genius programmer and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegra\\'s game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about her pod\\'s health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and Pikul in then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, TranscendenZ programmer.  Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you\\'ll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the \\'reality demonstrator\\' turns into Allegra, a \\'virtuality goddess\\').  What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? To be truly engaged in the world ?  And what about Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what ? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, The Mecanic -) ???   Yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; eXistenZ\\'s discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. And we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.',\n",

Of course it will appeal to highbrows for whom \"mainstream\" is a curse word, and who automatically add 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologies to Jeff Foxworthy).  The script is full of holes (has he written a book yet, or not?), cliches (relationship trouble: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice-over narration just to move the story along.  In an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off, it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of Julius Caesar.

Please don\\'t! This is no Disney film. This film tells us \\'life is cruel\\' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too.   The video box describes the film as a \\'delight for all ages\\' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a \\'family film\\'. I just had to find a definition of \\'family film\\' and came across the following: \"Usually consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children\\'s literature and can involve any number of helpful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination. Whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way.\" Not an apt description of Tarka The Otter, which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for young children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a \\'feel bad\\' movie. The lesson learned? As I said: life is cruel. Family entertainment? I don\\'t think so. Unless you hate your family, that is.

When she learns he has been murdered, she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can.  Sounds good, doesn\\'t it. Well, there\\'s really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts/blaxploitation action thriller, which is what this aims to be. The leads actually prove pretty good too with Jeanne Bell fitting nicely into the role of \"T.N.T.\" and Stan Shaw doing well as the ambitious, power-hungry Charlie. Where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up. The fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and/or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesn\\'t at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a Kung Fu action heroine. Also the poor lighting, actors sporting accents making them hard to understand, the confusing camera-work and the sometimes poor sound doesn\\'t help this obvious low budget effort out either any. This does deliver in one area which may delight some fans, it does offer up plenty of the T in \"T & A\", in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and Jeanne Bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless.  In the end, this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically, laughingly bad.',\n",

Under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesn\\'t even blink when doing so. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo. Where do all these bullets actually go to? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins doesn\\'t quite sound so punk) into the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that... especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it\\'s just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can\\'t act rappers out of the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came up with idea anyway? I\\'d lay odds it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic Angels.  The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don\\'t do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy come in and save the day.

This might be considered soft core S&M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place, and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.  What is the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We know that already. Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. A definite thumbs down.\",\n",
       " b\"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It's easy to see why the script for this film won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head was spinning from all of the snappy lines whizzing by. Noel Coward plays a New York publisher (`Why don't you publish books that you like?' - `What? And corrupt the public?') who charms and manipulates his many hangers-on. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre Flying Dutchman take-off in which Coward must find someone who truly mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. Very enjoyable until it gets bizarre. Viewed at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.\",\n",

You could not do better if you went to Istanbul yourself. We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay, concert clips of modern musical icons, a road show with a Romani (Gypsy) audience, Turkish Hip Hop (surprisingly very very good), and much much more. Some of the best female vocalists I've ever heard. A Kurdish woman singing in a hamam (steam bath) who will rip your heart out. Lots of social and political background. If this is your thing, you'll have a grand time. I could barely sit still in the theatre.  CD soundtrack now available on amazon. Pricey.\",\n",
       " b'This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman \"The EX\" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don\\'t think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband\\'s wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. At first when you watch this film, you think that the \"Ex\" wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her in a bad way. But in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. The two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). My advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like I did (at 1.15am on FOX)',\n",
       " b'\"The Mayor Of Hell\" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. James Cagney has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the \\'mayor\\' of the movie\\'s title is actually portrayed by Frankie Darro, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. Darro\\'s character is Jimmy Smith, a young tough who\\'s befriended by \\'Patsy\\' Gargan (Cagney), and is elected to the position when Gargan takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.  Warner Brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to Warden Thompson (Dudley Digges).  Cagney\\'s role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he\\'s still nominally in control of a criminal racket. The film\\'s attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as Gargan awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.  Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled \"Crime School\", featuring Humphrey Bogart in the Cagney role, and Billy Halop in the Frankie Darro part. If you\\'re partial to the Dead End Kids you\\'ll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan and Gabriel Dell. However the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with Bogart\\'s warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. Both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in \\'Mayor\\', Madge Evans is a reform minded nurse that falls for Cagney\\'s character.  Curiously, a lot of James Cagney\\'s early films aren\\'t commercially available, so you\\'ll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics, or source the film from a private collector. Personally, I can\\'t get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the Thirties and Forties.',\n",

       " b'This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there\\'s way too much \"plot\", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct. Cinematographically, it\\'s non-offensive, pretty much what you\\'d expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). The fact that New Concorde used footage from the \"Carnosaur\" films IS offensive, and quite confusing. For shame, New Concorde. For shame. \"Carnosaur\" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. See the \"Carnosaur\" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem.  I give it one star because I am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn\\'t have a zero.',\n",
       " b'I learned little of significance from this film that I did not already know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not follow the Enron case obsessively as did some others.) The film did a very poor job of explaining what \"business\" Enron was in that might actually have been on the up-and-up before it started hiding its debts in the entities created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly underplayed the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins in validating practices that were afterwards found to be illegal. Nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the \"investors\" -- all those prominent bankers -- thought they were doing. With the 24 hour a day cable networks, the Discovery Channel and the History Channel, documentaries have proliferated. I\\'ve seen many in the past year that were better than this one.',\n",

There are some \\'so bad its good\\' moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest. The woman who plays Tracey looks hideous. There are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly violated. On the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is \"trying to force us off the road\" without actually making contact. Guess the budget didn\\'t stretch to trashing cars. Oh and what looks like a Postcard of the Taj Mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country.',\n",

The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. Which is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but failed until now.   The first FIVE star episode for me.

       " b'The Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. let\\'s start with Hero High.  Hero High was intended to be a new Archies cartoon, featuring their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty), and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation couldn\\'t get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. Here\\'s the breakdown of characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Principal Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical lame Filmation jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun about it. It was entertaining enough for kids, though not quite up to previous standards.  The other segment was Shazam!, which was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. All of the major villains made appearances, as well as the entire Marvel Family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct WC Fields voice and shady character, as well as his perpetually acting up \"Shazambago\". Burr Middleton, a veteran of 70\\'s TV shows, like Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the early 6 Million Dollar Man episodes and voice of Skeletor in He-Man) handled Dr. Sivana.  The Marvels had always had a sense of whimsy to them, so little alteration was required for their adventures, to meet the Broadcast Standards and Practices requirements (the censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Amongst the villains who appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac, and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his on screen debut.  Hero High is due to be released from BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo, as well as the live-action show. Hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them loose on DVD. It is well worth watching and deserving of DVD treatment.',\n",
       " b'What an atrocity. I am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie, but the plot and screenplay of \"Killing Zoe\" are so artless that I found myself wincing through the entire (mercifully short) ninety minutes of the film.  Readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with American safecracker Zed, is also an employee at the bank that Zed will help rob in a high-stakes Bastille Day heist.  The film strains one\\'s credibility from the get-go. Zed and Zoe\\'s night of magic is highly prosaic, and Zoe\\'s claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime would seem to reflect the screenwriter\\'s lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual on-screen chemistry. Zed\\'s complete indifference when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachment.  In act two, Eric\\'s band of bohemians--drug-addled losers leading a marginal life of petty crime--prepare for their big heist with a night on the town. Here Roger Avary\\'s main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. A secondary thread involves convincing us (by endless repetition) that Eric is really, REALLY glad to see his old friend Zed again. Really glad. Eric\\'s devil-may-care, over-the-top flamboyance and affection for Zed isn\\'t even remotely believable--check out, for example, his phony bemusement at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building. Development of the characters who will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought.  The heist is a disaster--understandable, since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, though, he\\'s just more boring than boring. To build up the excitement, there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe. This was boring in video games, and it\\'s boring now.  Zoe is taken hostage during the heist but despite our expectation that she\\'ll play a pivotal role, she just sits pretty. Or more precisely, Avary fails to do anything with her. In literally the last five minutes she springs to life, breaks the hostage situation and saves the grateful, but still dazed Zed from suffering any consequences of his crime. Why she doesn\\'t mind his involvement in the crime--or why she gives a damn about him at all--is impossible to tell. After all, she\\'s had no chance to see that he\\'s any more decent than the rest of the gang.  Throughout, the dialogue is stilted and phony. Much of it is in French. As a native speaker, I can certify that it doesn\\'t ring even remotely true. Eric\\'s sugary-sweet discourse, rapidly alternating with tough-guy boasting, is meant to be at turns charming and scary, but is instead just grating. Meanwhile his scaredy-cat accomplices are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is gunned down in a ludicrous example of excessive force, we can all breathe a sigh of relief: like the bank hostages, we will soon be freed from this miserable ordeal.',\n",
       " b'It is definitely not worth spending either money or time. It is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. Never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to either of their characters. Probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought about to the characters. Finally, it is a movie with no fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy , no action, no thrill, no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. I shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a \"must watch\" movie.',\n",
       " b'That\\'s pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle. Camilla Belle isn\\'t much of an actress, and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller.  But if you\\'re looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you\\'ll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she\\'s providing her sitting services, searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going \"bump\" in the night. As she lurks around corners and peers down hallways, we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like Roman tubs, a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving, and the piece de resistance, a self-contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self-watering system.  Because the movie isn\\'t compelling enough to draw us into Jill\\'s fear, we\\'re distracted by the grandeur of the house, which isn\\'t something you should be doing when you\\'re watching a thriller. Even as Jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we cringe because she\\'s breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond, not because she\\'s about to get murdered.  The movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies, and the ending is anything but original. By the time it was over, I just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real. Never mind Jill and the kids she was babysitting.  2 stars - both for the house.',\n",
       " b\"THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar.  Almodovar has always single handed the flag for Spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came Amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. It is a heartbreaking experience specially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die\\xc2\\x85 but when you strip a man of his dreams\\xc2\\x85 The film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination, probably in favour of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting looked effortless and I reckon Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. I was never fond of his early work but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference for Spanish cinema in the whole world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize at Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off\\xc2\\x85 what about some Science Fiction now? Whose life is it anyway?****.\",\n",

       " b\"The topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transportation, oil & gas depletion, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc.  The problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. One viewpoint is presented, then hammered upon the viewer over and over. You see the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly making their case. The supposed 'narrator' starts off sounding like a news reporter, but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma.  The dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion, but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails. They paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world. It would certainly spell the end of globalization, and better still, the end of Walmart. I will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen.  I gave it 3 stars because I appreciated the old footage and the premise.\",\n",
       " b'Oh, dear! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It\\'s unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. I wouldn\\'t mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn\\'t; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him. I\\'ve rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him an \"actor\") but that\\'s not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work with (sample line: \"Computers killed my brother!\"). The plot is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent Terminator; the special effects are laughable. Overall, this film is just utterly dreadful. And why does everything explode?',\n",
       " b\"This is far the most worst film I've seen this year from Bollywood so far. I may not lie, my wife liked this film very much. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal what made this film become unbelievable, but it was Amisha Patel. She performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where (luckily for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with. When I saw this film, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with her performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level in performing as an actress.  Anyway, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It is the clich\\xc3\\xa9 story. Sudden Arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair, but then Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor in my point of view, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep into the ground. I must say Bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far. Bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him. He was so bad in acting in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe every word he says. Only a movie with high potential like a Yash Copra film has to meet his way.  Okay, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, someones enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this crap? I don't. Why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like Bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) Patel. This movie was so awful, that I regret buying it.\",\n",
       " b\"I was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though I payed 4 bucks for matin\\xc3\\xa9e (before 6pm) prices.  The remake's story was ho-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no I did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake.   I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer Morlocks over this junk any time. My estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth.   When the 60s version came out (I first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. You don't have to have an over abundance of CGI in a movie for it to be better. Too much of this looks fake. I can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.\",\n",
       " b'I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.  On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: \"\\'Deed Poll\\' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. The brilliant acting of Barbara Kowa and Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). However, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains.\" Unfortunately, this is true. I wasn\\'t intrigued by the story at all. The protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. So what? For many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.  What\\'s the point of the movie? What\\'s the message behind it all? The anonymous reviewer said: \"Somehow Biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. Thus the boredom I blame on the movie. The movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn\\'t take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the English pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. Some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. As a spectator one has to regret the chances given away.\" Again, I must agree. I did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)  All in all, \"Deed Poll\" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.',\n",
       " b'\\'Be With Me\\' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it\\'ll end.   Alas, as I watched it alone, and so I felt like I almost watched the world\\'s worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a \\'Thank you\\' to the movie\\'s sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries. Aha! Methought: How surprising is *that* - given all the shots of Tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie?   Meanwhile, dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth, but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movie\\'s overall story is said or witnessed. It\\'s as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and you\\'d really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency, or part of its plot, as far as the movie\\'s overall progression was concerned. Thus the ultimate \"wallpaper movie\"!  Well I wonder... What movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching? I wonder and continue to wonder... It certainly couldn\\'t have been this arty to the point of artless Singaporean excuse for a camera\\'s rolling. Allegedly, \\'Be With Me\\' is supposed to be woven around the themes of \"love, tragedy and redemption\". But all I witnessed was boredom, a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages, and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended. What a wistful waste of time, it ended up being! It was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for Theresa Chan who is a \"remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities...\" Well, no disrespect to Ms Chan, but given that she was such a marvellous & amazing character, why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together? Yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling. Rather than tying in the fates of all characters, I really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concerned.  I am generally an art-house movie fan and don\\'t usually object to slow pacing (of which here there is no shortage, believe you me!!). I hate such movies as 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but consider, e.g., Eric Rohmer as a great film maker. So I hope that puts my criticism into some perspective. Nonetheless, there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movie\\'s conception and delivery which could prevent one\\'s eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of \\'Be With Me\\' dripped by. Watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time. Otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it. 3/10',\n",
       " b'I had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it. A friend purchased it for \\xc2\\xa31 and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back cover.  10 minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effort.  The scenes were very poorly acted, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long, just so the movie would be of a reasonable length.  For instance when the lead character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene, with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plot.  The lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them HIV, he never once thinks to get tested. Instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and sawing her into pieces.  If this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore, think again. This film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of film.  It does not scare, it does not make you think, it does not offer fast paced fun. It may however put you to sleep, it is certain to bore you to tears, so please save yourself the despair and follow my heading.  AVOID THIS FILM 1/2 out of 10 (this does not deserve even 1)  The film was 78 minutes but seemed as if it was 2 1/2 hours.',\n",
       " b\"I was hugely impressed with this movie, if for nothing else than for the comedy. It might not be the edgiest, wittiest humor at all times, but I found it appropriate to every scene.  The flow of the film is certainly a bit jumbled, almost confusing sometimes, but that is how the characters feel. Sometimes, we're watching a bit of slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive discourse on relationships. This might be a bit frustrating to certain viewers, but it brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos.  The acting is great from everyone. I'm a huge Andy Richter fan, but I wasn't head over heels for his part like everyone else seems to be. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. Jay Mohr performs as expected, if you've seen him in other films. I've always liked him.  Overall, the movie is very funny and offers some nice foundations for a few types of relationships. When it comes to relationship questions and problems, some films try to surprise. There's nothing surprising about the conclusions offered here, but it's entertaining to watch them be revealed throughout the film.\",\n",
       " b\"Avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but I personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. It gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. Furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie.   I believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but I surely didn't noticed! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. I have to say I fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and I am still not sure it was worth it...\",\n",

The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it? Is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land?   Watching this, I kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually I realized I had seen this exact same movie when I was but a little kid..suddenly the memories flooded back and I remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends. As an adult though, the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this, while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film, remains a lot of fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels as Tonto steals a lot of this movie as he's probably in more action scenes than even the Lone Ranger. There's some very familiar faces on hand here including Douglas Kennedy as Ross Brady, headman of the Hooded Raiders gang, Charles Watts as a bigoted Sheriff, and Ralph Moody as a kindly Padre.\",\n",
       " b\"This movie is absolutely terrible... Definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. Too bad Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies.

Of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-Die evil Americans'.  Unless braindead movies are you game, don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. Pick up 'the Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now' instead.\",\n",
       " b\"Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head. The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to Jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body. This movie has an interesting enough story, but it plays out very bad here. Everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once.\",\n",
       " b'It is a wonderful film about people. Strange people. The characters in the movie all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd; but that does not make the movie worse, only better, for it is shot in a kind of fantasy-like way, so nothing is real. This review might sound a little weird, but then again, the movie is not quite normal... It is also a hilarious movie at many times. If you have not seen it, see it. Enjoy!',\n",

But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' The humour was varied which I loved. All the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!\",\n",

Though I don\\'t like it, but I had no choice, I saw the movie in French, but I know that hearing the real voices of Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful.

Here\\'s a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the Basie Band the year before (1951). And some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster.   However, the story line is pathetic, even by 1952 musical comedy standards. And the other songs are equally as forgettable as Evening In Paris cologne. The dialogue embarrasses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin\\'s Boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensional.  So, how to enjoy this movie on video ?   A.) Fast forward through all the dialogue...  B.) Surrender yourself to Doris Day\\'s vocals and Ray Bolger\\'s loose-limbed footwork. And don\\'t miss Dauphin\\'s hilarious take on a rain-soaked, windswept reprise of \"April In Paris\"...  C.)

       " b'This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that\\'s holding it back.  Awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a let down in practically every other way.  An \"adaptation\" of sorts, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, setting it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let\\'s face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there\\'s one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it\\'s Shakespeare\\'s. So any adaptation, if it\\'s not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.  And that\\'s what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. It\\'s the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. Except with guns and in different outfits.  Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which I completely tuned out, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go.  I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.  A shame. An absolute shame.',\n",

Billie Piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin-wrong personality,modern make-up,completely wrong hair (there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like that),she didn't seem particularly meek nor put-upon by the family and I didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind.  The picnic(substituted for the ball) was so low-budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the Portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting room.)  To those responsible:-If you haven't the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing Jane Austen.  It was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90% nothing much at all  PS Edmund was very good\",\n",

In my experience, really, really bad films can often be as much fun as really good ones, and no film featuring a decapitation by machete-enhanced ceiling fan should ever be considered completely worthless; but even though Killing Spree very occasionally manages to entertain with its inventiveness and cheap and cheerful gore, I found that the terrible direction, awful production values, ugly cinematography, muffled sound, dreadful lighting, mind numbingly tedious and daft narrative (which includes a really dumb plot twist that is telegraphed from the beginning, plus a pointless zombie finale), nasty synthesizer score, inane dialogue, and thoroughly amateurish acting all served to make this effort from writer/director Tom Ritter a virtually joyless experience.',\n",

Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering. Or not, depending on the audience.  A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement. If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.

       " b'\"Hell To Pay\" bills itself as the rebirth of the Classic Western... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby-boomers experienced decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this film) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and it\\'s fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this one, maybe even better than his days as \"The Virginian.\" In a way, \"Hell To Pay\" reminds me of those movies in the 60\\'s where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance. If you\\'re of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a \"wow\" factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days. \"Hell To Pay\" features screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of \"newbies\" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), who I\\'ve seen lately on \"The Young and The Restless\" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays the angst-ridden Kirby, a war-weary man who\\'s torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to \"do the right thing.\" William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance, Kirby\\'s mischievous and womanizing brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah\\'s sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process.

       " b'This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It\\'s the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.  The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original.  \\'The Long Kiss\\' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment.   This has to be Jackson\\'s funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. No quirky Tarantino hit-man, super-cool Shaft, or borderline psycho soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the everyman we identify with. The poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman\\'s odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.  Though the story claims that Davis\\'s character, Samantha Caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.  Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of Charly to emerge again.  The materials of her past life excavated by Jackson\\'s detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charly\\'s resurfacing. Good timing, too, considering the target Samantha makes of herself.  But Charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. One gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the \"Chapter\".  In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche, though, her Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (She\\'s even funnier that Charly.) This was probably due to becoming a mother, because it\\'s the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly\\'s struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration by movie\\'s end.  It\\'s impossible to choose a \"best quote\" from this film:  \"Now you\\'re a sharpshooter?\"  \"I saved your ass. It was great!\"  \"Continue dying. Out.\"  \"I sock \\'em in the jaw and yell \\'Pop goes the weasel\\'\".  And a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.  Geena Davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she\\'s turning forty. (Listen to Charley\\'s history, do the math).  Fantastic soundtrack, too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye.   I give \\'The Long Kiss Goodnight\\' a 9, only because I don\\'t believe in a perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. Nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to \\'It\\'s A Wonderful Life.\\'',\n",

This movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies.  When a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius. Surprisingly enough, it is, this movie is directed by Oliver Stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time.  This movie's screenplay was co-written by Oliver Stone and Eric Bogosian (Barry Champlain, main character.). With Oliver Stone's help, the screenplay was created as a seamless, rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence. If you have an open mind about any subjects, and the wit to comprehend others, then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch, immediately.\",\n",
       " b'I love the other reviews of this movie. They mirror my attitude. I am a 70\\'s sort of guy, minus disco and \"Star Wars\" childishness. There was nothing great about this movie, except for a chase scene. That is why it was good, because it was tough, basic and economical. Roy Scheider carried the movie, which was based on the crew, the 7 Ups, that backed up Gene Hackman in the \"French Connection\". The people in it were believable and average, who burned themselves pouring coffee, showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash.  Maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked. There was no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns. There was no tough guy philosophizing, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. There was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else\\'s reactions. The criminals were bad guys but they didn\\'t shoot people for the hell of it. As a matter of fact, there was a body count of just three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. It could be a G movie today! No bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. There were no high tech hijinks, nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious, the highest tech thing I saw was a touch tone ATT wall phone. It had no subplots or amusing character developments. Also, no sex or women, except for one mobster\\'s wife who did some screaming as the Buddy our hero had her menaced.  It was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs. The undertakers. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco who did a great job, as good as Roy Schneider, Buddy the head of 7 Ups cop, whom he informed and exploited. What ever happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he seemed like a Pacino shoe in, good looking and talented? What it did have was a great NYC backdrop to a simple crime story. Locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. It had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of Buddy\\'s cop got accidentally involved, literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit, both the NYPD Brass and mobsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance. Obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. Even the mobsters were plain, old and ugly, no Godfather royalty or Soprano hipness here.  It is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70\\'s d Pontiacs. Even the cars were plain and economical, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, like the acting and the story. In the days of Batman uber-hype or \"24\" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle, amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.',\n",

Their leader is a real old man who has aged well. There's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. Lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film. It looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood. While each member of the cast brought their own talents, it really didn't all click as a film. The effects were OK, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires. If you're looking for lots of blood and violence, this is for you.\",\n",
       " b\"Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast.  In Australia these movies were sub-titled in English and while French movies here often get a mainstream release, German movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience. But like BMWs and Mercedes when Germans get it right I really like their films. Like PQ the time here went so quickly, lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time.  While many films are overlong this one I could have watched much more of. It had the sort of characters and character development for a series. Given time I will re-read AriesGemini100 review and reference the actors I liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them. I agree....most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this fine film. I did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise it felt very real. And quite romantic in it's way.  Viva la Deutcsh!\",\n",
       " b'Whew! What can one say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u-mentory about Ed Wood\\'s cross-dressing fantasies?? Well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw slabs of innocuous, incidental stock footage, and then builds a \"story\" around them - and what a story!! Wood himself stars as Glen, a regular Joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee\\'s lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world by showing that Glen is just like all of us underneath, only in angora. Ummm...ok. But then, we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid Puppetmaster. Lugosi is a howl, spouting out such rubbish as \"Beeevaaare...the beeeg greeeen dragon that seeets at your doorstep: he eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails, and beeeeeg snails!\" Um, ok, Bela... :=8/ There is a strange, twisted type of Wood logic going on here. Afterall, he does remind us that \"7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald\". Hmmm, must be that alien/cross-dressing/habidashery cowspiracy-thang!! Glen or Glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable Wood schlock-actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller, and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one. Everybody by now knows Bela\\'s sad story: by the time Wood used him for this flic, he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah, but even for him this is depth heretofore unreached. One of the MooCow\\'s favorite Wood mooments comes with the stock footage charging buffalo scene - it is sooo loopily demented!! The MooCow says \"Puuuull de schtriiiiings\", and git yer hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won\\'t believe it! :\\xc2\\x8d',\n",
       " b'I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 specifically is trying to target, so I can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age, the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. The show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence, and the lovely, incredibly tan, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course.  The story lines all revolve around Zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym class, resulting in Zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. There is generally a B-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character, or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. These plots often play off stereotypes, such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. The majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won\\'t-they Chase-Zoey dynamic.  The characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything,Chase, the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing Best Friend, Michael, the token black guy (kudos to Christopher Massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners), Lola, the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom, despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater), Logan, the womanizing narcissist, Dustin, the spazzy little brother, and Quinn, the science geek. The few words I spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely.  Zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times, but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. Zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless, still manages major character flaws. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being \"freaky\".  As for the acting, it is quite clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. The supporting cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. They deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot hasn\\'t yet ventured into obscurity.  All in all, Zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life, and anyone past their Limited Too years shouldn\\'t expect much from it.',\n",
       " b\"An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds.

With actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian, a script that was written by the director\\'s 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, poverty-row special effects, and to top it off, a director that thought making this crap would make them famous. The end result wasn\\'t spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. From Venus must have been fun to make and I\\'m sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie.  A 2 out of 10 for a valiant, hopeless effort.  ',\n",
       " b'Fires on The Plain (1959) ****  You don\\'t see films like this anymore. \\'Fires on the Plain\\' is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. Kon Ichikawa\\'s masterpiece follows Tamura, a soldier with Tuberculosis as he wanders around the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back. His CO tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is refused again, but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day they are shelled by American troops and Tamura flees, choosing not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to Palompon. He discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive, while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back.  The film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation, with a hint of insanity. Everyone we see is skin and bones, covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are bitingly hilarious. Take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water; a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up, to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies \"what was that?\" and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail. He takes the boots, replacing them with his old ones. Another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole. He looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground, and deciding that they\\'re both kaput he removes his own and goes barefoot. The film is filled with incredible scenes, one after another. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures. There are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above.   The film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film. They represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary; the lives of Japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn. Their beacons of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands.  The film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa\\'s Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. Clint Eastwood\\'s Letters From Iwo Jima, while it is a very good film, comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in Fires on the Plain. (Eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film, seeing as he claims to be such a classic Japanese film buff.) Many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. In Fires on the Plain, we\\'re shown that war is even more hellish when you\\'re on the losing end   4/4',\n",
       " b'I haven\\'t any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie is one HUGE non-sequitur! It is an affront to the noble B Western films of the \\'30\\'s. I have seen many of Wayne\\'s early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.  The bad guy is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow\\'s scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches. Simultaneously, his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory. Then they decide to move on to bank robbery. To do this, they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun - no explanation of why that\\'s necessary or how he got that neato little toy!  No single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here. The Shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes.   He imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall-safe. (Knock-knock, who\\'s there?) He is apparently clairvoyant, because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - PRESTO - he\\'s there. (I can just imagine that he has met them face-to-face and says,\"I have some secret, nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed - meet me at the wall-safe and I\\'ll give \\'em to you.\") Just why the Shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is, like most of the elements of this mess, never explained.  He has a nifty tunnel to the ol\\' hollow stump across the street from which vantage point, various of his baddies perform assassinations. He also has a hidden panel NOT in his secret lair behind the fake safe, but out in the main room.  When not behind the safe, he hangs out on his cow-less ranch, masquerading as rancher Matlock. We learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch - two brothers - and assumed the identity of one. The daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930\\'s NYC (judging by her wardrobe), and she apparently never met her real uncle, because he dupes her, too!  If you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats, you need to see this movie. Here, the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head-bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired! It\\'s like a game of pick-up basketball - only Wayne has them tying bandanas \\'round their heads instead of just taking off their shirts.  Perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending. Immediately after subduing the Shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the erst-while niece) on the front porch of their home. (Never mind that there has been scant romance.) There, Yak is playing with Wayne\\'s 3-4 year old son, dressed up in Injun garb! (Hiyoo, skookum fun!)  No thanks to this nonsense, Wayne went on to become a screen legend. Only a super-star (packer or not!) could surmount this entry in a film resume. Long live the Duke!',\n",
       " b'Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who\\'s accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can\\'t get out of until the dastardly plot that\\'s behind their troubles is resolved. That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do in this fine film. Barry Kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping Fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $100 bill to Fry later on...that was BIG money in 1943!! It\\'s Barry\\'s acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he\\'s wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can\\'t clear himself. Similar to The 39 Steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-Nazi, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch\\'s trademark touches of humor are here, too. Patricia is a billboard model who\\'s various roadside ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a trucker who\\'s a one-man comedy act \"Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day.\" Field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the \"suits\" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. During a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. Awful for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the Statue of Liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.',\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision. The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialog/scripting, and overall quality. I give it two thumbs way up!',\n",

Brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as Ameche\\'s doddering old coot. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as Ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version (with Selleck getting poked, bumped, prodded, and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!). Either way, it\\'s a painful experience, and Selleck\\'s sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he hobbles around and howls in pain, but retains his heart of mush.

       " b\"The gate to Hell has opened up under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway. Wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic. Good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting. I've watched this twice now and I still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms. Nothing is clear and honestly I didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved (Second billed Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film.) The idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script goes nowhere. Take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this.\",\n",
       " b'In the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the Mississippi.  Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters.  Because of the motivational direction of both the director Robert Lieberman and the Buffalo Bills\\' last minute QB, Dan \"Give \\'em hell\" Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor, Gil Bellows) the oft Super Bowl snake-bitten Bills find themselves in the ultimate position.  With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT.  The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer\\'s first name, Jenifur Jarvis.  ',\n",

Typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it\\'s worth by Terence Fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading British horror film directors at the Hammer studio.

       " b'Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.  In relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. Years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series. Not only that, the cultural mistakes were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing (Greek style) and breaking plates, which does not exists anywhere within the Turkish culture.  Some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the TV series but this theory has one major fall, the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all. So with that note in mind, me and everyone I know, would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims.',\n",
       " b'Hi To read the entire plot around \"OZ\" just look at IMDb here to find it.  **WARNING SPOILERS INSIDE THIS REVIEW !** Oz is the a series that has not only moved me but also shows a small bit. Of the American prison system, but i have to say (judging on discovery channels program over jail) it is not really realistic.  Although i got to say, there not shy, rapes,shanking (stabbing) happens allot. Still it is television, so for you ppl out there that think this is realistic wrong.  There is a good degree of violence in it, and some here and there overdone scenes (plot over plot over plot) that can get pretty boring. But remember the series is almost ancient by now. So times do change as well i believe i should judge this in the time line as it came out.  As the season prolonged up to season 5 it was pretty good!. Until one of the cons wins a lottery ticket of 2 million dollars, because he talked to god it struck me as \"ok this is getting to the point i do not want to see this series no more\" Still i proceeded! And now i just seen the episode 3 of season 6. This is were cereal gets his brain zapped and then his \"mom\" hold him after, while he is drooling. Then you see O Reilly cry as well seeing his bro like that (RL BROTHERS As well) Now thats by far the best scene out of the entire \"OZ\" series, that was real to me! Still do not read this wrong that I\\'m trying to crash and burn it. It is a really good series! And even now 2010 well worth a watch ! I give it a 7 because of the storyline that weakens with the season. But still a golden glove.',\n",
       " b'The first time I had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the, er... \"washroom\" after having just seen Fight Club. In each urinal was deposited a small, round black circle. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it caused a colour picture to form, with photographs of the two stars and the tag line \"You\\'ll P*** Yourself Laughing\". When you\\'d finished washing your hands, the circle had dried and faded to black again, waiting to spring it\\'s surprise on the next \"victim\".  Okay, maybe the punchline wasn\\'t terribly sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say I\\'ve never seen anything like it in my life before, and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing, that\\'s a real feat. What a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.  I hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and I am indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series, be it the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), the sitting room plays of Bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, such as Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. Unfortunately, its an 89 minute film.  There\\'s definitely some merit to be had, and I laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale, which spoofed the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and involved... well, you\\'ll have to see that bit for yourself. Yet often the pace is leaden, and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. The two stars (Edmondson taking his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear, Mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. Indeed, the writers\\' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (Richie\\'s effeminate, failed social-climbing for example) are not present here, and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.  The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water, complete with drunken chef and unseen, called-for waiter \"Pasquele\", which uncannily rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens\\' swing hanging over a cliff face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn\\'t there, and all the \"dead laugh\" areas patched up with incidental \"comedy\" music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago.  Paridiso\\'s brand of puerile, sadistic, perverse humour IS funny, and I feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.',\n",
       " b'The role of Buddy Ackerman is no stretch for Kevin Spacey. He\\'s played version of that character many times other, better films. This is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce. The script leaves little time for plot or character development, resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the \"good stuff\". The difference is that here the \"good stuff\" isn\\'t people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain, making it appropriate viewing for young adults.  Of course there\\'s nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex, and I guess there\\'s nothing wrong with \"Swimming with Sharks\" if you want to watch people undergoing physical, emotional, and psychological torture. But if you\\'re looking for incisive satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions, you should probably look elsewhere.',\n",

So a few weeks later I enter my video store, and I see David Michael Latt\\'s version of War Of The Worlds on the shelf. \"It couldn\\'t have come onto DVD, that fast, could it?\" I said to myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell, instead. \"Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!\" So I thought, it might have been a try.  I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as I watched the opening credits, watched them take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did. The whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. From the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it didn\\'t even come close to being as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What the crap? I ended up being so bored, that I had to fast forward through the movie until I found something that looked even remotely interesting. And nothing was really.  My advice: Don\\'t even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. The Spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! But please, please, I beg of you! Stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!',\n",

Like the DVD synopsis says, \"As secrets are revealed and clues unraveled, (the five men) must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive.\" This story reads a lot better than it looks on film, unfortunately. When the secrets are finally revealed, and memories become clear, there is no longer much interest in what has happened. Simply, director Simon Brand has a great premise with Matthew Waynee\\'s idea, but they encumber light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick.  **** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby',\n",
       " b'Aksar is an awful movie. The script, the story, the acting are all simply laughable. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. She is good-looking but has zero acting talent. The film has one hit song called \"Jhalak Diklaja\" which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I never could understand the hype around this song as I never found it particularly good though it is catchy. The film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at any cost.',\n",
       " b'I don\\'t pretend to be a huge Asterix fan, having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics, but this was a superb movie, all the same. I only saw the English version, and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix especially. The story itself was both interesting and truly funny (especially the contradicting name endings - all the viking names end in \"af\", while all the Gaulish names, of course, end in \"ix\"), with a little romance thrown in that (I though) enhanced the story, even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clich\\xc3\\xa9s.   The plot is this - the Viking chief, Timandahaf, is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied. So, he consults his \"wise man\", Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that \"fear lends the villagers wings\". Taking this literally, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly, and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the \"Champion of Fear\", an expedition that, of course, leads him to the Gaulish village where Asterix and Obelix live.   The pair are currently very frustrated - Chief Vitalstatistix\\'s cowardly, pacifist nephew, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man, and the boy is making little to no progress. When Justforkix unwittingly confesses to being \"afraid of everything\" in the presence of the brainless viking Olaf, he is believed to be the \"Champion of Fear\", and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home.  Ultimately, this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clich\\xc3\\xa9s and, at times, defective dialogs. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the fact that it wasn\\'t true to the comic.',\n",
       " b'The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late. The final straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says he\\'s too busy to take her out to celebrate. So, not wanting to just stay home, she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after Sothern breaks off her relationship with Kelly that new boyfriend Hamilton is a \"love \\'em and leave \\'em\" sort of guy. How all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.  This is a very modest little film from Columbia Pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars. It\\'s clearly a \"B-movie\" despite there being small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell--as both had yet to become famous. Now this is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production isn\\'t any good. In fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. That\\'s because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. Plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. The ending, in particular, is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! Because of these factors, the film earns a 7 of 10.',\n",
       " b'I was unsure what to expect from \"driving lessons\"- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.  Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.  Highly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.',\n",
       " b'I just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn\\'t funny or that it\\'s boring.   Here\\'s the trick --- the film is not meant to be just a comedy. It\\'s got some depth to it. Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves.   Unfortunately, the movie and home video industries don\\'t deal well with subtlety and drop this in the \"COMEDY\" bin. It IS funny, but a lot of the humor is off-beat. However, the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.  It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining.   And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can, in a role which requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you\\'ve got a great cast throughout which here, as usual, makes a great difference.  Matthew Modine is fun, but more important, he\\'s a major hottie in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy.  Sit back, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.',\n",
       " b'Before I\\'d seen this movie I\\'ve heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how \"horrific\" it was. Not to take any credit away from this movie, I think it wasn\\'t all that horrible or even shocking. It\\'s just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town. And a good one at portraying the point.  There\\'s some great acting here and a well-thought of manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer in the Finnish movie scene and he\\'s the best in what comes to describing the contemporary Finnish culture (albeit he\\'s not the only one writer for this movie, but I dare say he\\'s the main-writer anyway. Correct me if I\\'m wrong).  The casting is excellent, except for Jasper P\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4kk\\xc3\\xb6nen (the pseudo-main character, who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie.  This movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous Finnish band\\'s very well known song (Eppu Normaali\\'s \"Tuhansien Murheellisten Laulujen Maa\", which VERY roughly translated to \"Paha Maa\") throughout the whole Finnish society lead to a sad, dark end accompanied with booze, lonesomeness and the bad choices. And it\\'s the side of everyday Finnish life about 80% of the population have no awareness of, unless movies like this are made.',\n",
       " b\"It's a soap-opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea. A movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I didn't get any emotion from it, the ideas are not at all new, the tension lacks, it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end I think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way. I mean you have this middle-aged, paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than Don Juan. He doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no issues with God (and one would probably expect that too), the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves (I can't get out of my mind Bergman's Cries and Whispers, similar to this one in many respects, which simply bursts with emotions, and not all of them humane) etc. This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away. The movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer. Amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides, he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. Still I have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded.\",\n",
       " b'Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations. And the fact that it was more of an art house movie.',\n",
       " b'This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you. The makings of a real cult classic. It has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The buffoon, A MONSTER TRUCK and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. This one is full of blood,guts and gore. I strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours, and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of Monster trucks, Bad {But Funny } One liners and our Hero eating eye ball stew. Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. Just remember WARNING..... Do NOT EAT BEFORE VIEWING THIS FILM...',\n",
       " b\"Perhaps not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help but love it to death. A five-year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet, but it really is a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy names her, is taken back to the sea by her father, who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human, but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. Where the film really comes alive, though, is in its tremendous artwork. The drawings are more child-like than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but there's beauty in its simplicity. As with all of his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was just so in awe of. Seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago (the score here is equally as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.\",\n",
       " b\"I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used every cheesy racism clich\\xc3\\xa9 in the book. It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn't all bad.I just can't believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.\",\n",
       " b'I thought i could see something good but... I am tired after seeing this movie, i don\\'t know what i hated the most: the script, the acting, the FX or the music. Try to picture the worst Power Rangers episode and would still be to kind. I\\'ve seen better FX in FPS Games( The touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I did liked how the women in the car was screaming, when the \"monster\" was walking around the car (even if she\\'s looking in the wrong way). So give your self a break and don\\'t watch this thing, at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you, trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.',\n",
       " b\"This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had it all--music, stories, a talking squirrel, and chuckling daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we got three New York channels with our cable hook-up, and I think it was on Channel 11. They just don't make shows like this anymore (I know that makes me sound really old), and it blows my mind that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something cool to watch. I've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show. She's three years younger than me, and she grew up in North Jersey. I would love to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what silly (but great) stuff her mom used to watch! I just found a VHS tape of a few episodes, and a music CD from the show on ebay, and I bought them right up, even though they were a little pricey. I can't wait to get them to re-live the great memories!\",\n",
       " b'Late film critic Gene Siskel said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie. He was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days. Even though I didn\\'t always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a shining example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations.  The story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall(Larenz Tate) and Nina(Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two whenever the are on screen and its fantastic.  Bill Bellamy is pretty funny as the deceitful Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson is great as Nina\\'s friend Simone. Isaiah Washington is just as great as Darius\\'s close friend Savon and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by industry lowlifes and the childish games they play. You can believe that he called the little weasel on Grey\\'s Anatomy out of his name but anybody that knows how Follywood works knows better than to believe any \"official story\" from the place of make believe. At any rate...  Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters that are in realistic situations that anybody that has been in love can relate too. You love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. Not one obscene stereotype can be found here. Contrast that with the Romance movies of toady. Exactly. In closing if you love Black Cinema then you would do well to own a copy of this movie.',\n",
       " b'This is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now demystifed).  First, did the film makers understand the concept of \\'parody\\' before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film? Parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock, comment on, or pay homage through self-depreciating humour to, the original work. In other words, there should be reasons to parody such work, and they should definitely be clever. I didn\\'t see any of those in the film. I did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said \"hey, I was drunk last night, watching Survivors, and had this brain fart for a straight to DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script...because I plan to direct this film without one!\"   And herein lies the second mystery: Eric Robert\\'s career. I use to think Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I realize it\\'s because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career that he had). After watching this movie, it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films, which has higher budgets, more...intense...scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and compelling plot lines, and a much wider audience than this B-movie reject (C-movie?).',\n",
       " b\"Hadn't really heard too much about this movie so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think this movie moved too slowly.  When the movie opens up, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene, the dialouge, were all great. And then the movie went downhill.  While I respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. It was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors.  Don't waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.\",\n",
       " b\"This is another one of those fundamentalist Christian movies that hit you over the head with religion like a sledgehammer. You know you are in trouble when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous. Three men are flying to Mexico to deliver Bibles. This makes no sense since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic bibles are not the same. The Catholic bible has books in it that are not in the Protestant bible. I also find it difficult to believe that churches in Mexico would not distribute bibles to them. I can understand if they were going to a place where Christianity is in the minority. But Mexico is far fetched. If you cannot believe the setup of a story, then you don't the rest of the story either. A movie about religion can be entertaining, but not this movie.\",\n",
       " b\"Publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the Duke of Mantua urinating during his reprise of La Donna \\xc3\\xa8 Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda sing Caro Nome in the bath. It is just crass and boring. What stands out about this film is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets the Duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. In fact, he is not the Duke, he is just a character named Duka, so it's difficult to see why he has lots of hangers-on and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors.The Duke's, sorry Duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (Yawn).   Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. What can we make of the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? When the call goes out that Monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. One imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool.  It was common for opera films to be lip-synced 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. A dubbed opera is like soft porn. You don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. It is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. The Duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon.  The ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. Fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub.  This is a film of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They normally perform in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland I would have been fairly indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule.\",\n",
       " b\"I'm 35. Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead, and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was cool also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for Bruce's early fans. Either I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm just not part of Bruce's target audience anymore. I'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film. But this over extended matin\\xc3\\xa9e sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. Campbell better talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last Evil Dead reunion picture to get back my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera... Sorry Bruce, this just doesn't cut it for me. Take care.\",\n",
       " b\"Duck_of_Death needs to watch this film again, as his major criticism is completely baseless. The film never once forgot about the time delay, and it was mentioned explicitly in a couple of places. The crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn't obey the time delay rules.  One thing I did think was a bit far-fetched was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land on a planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned space ship go into a star's corona? I doubt it. Would humans land on a moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation? I doubt it. Also, the ship seemed overly sturdy. Would a ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down? I doubt it. Would it survive being hit by comet debris? I doubt it. I think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much. But all-in-all, the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting, especially by the actors portraying the ship's commander and the Russian cosmonaut.\",\n",
       " b\"I was amazed about this early performance of Clint Eastwood. I had not read a summary of the film, when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood, I expected some nice shootings and no deep story. I was quite mistaken. I found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end, I couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. This movie is definitely not typical Eastwood, but surely worth watching.\",\n",

       " b'I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp\\'s mother. A mother like Garp\\'s would have had her kids taken away by the Department of Children and Families.   Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me. He has two roles he can play: Funny person or sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. See the Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam, and all of his so-called \"dramatic\" roles. It is always the same performance. Put them all together into one long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember Fatal Attraction? Would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any sparks between her and Michael Douglas?? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warm up any screen?? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. Garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound.',\n",
       " b'It doesn\\'t take balls to make-fun of retarded people. Having to listen to Mencia insist that he is brave to make \"retard\" jokes is intolerable. Also, it doesn\\'t take balls to bite off of the chapelle show. The racial game-shows, the racial olympics, it seems like a lot of the skits are merely reworked Chapelle Show skits, that are just way less funny.   But the most irksome thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the beat of his own drum, when he is actually marching to the beat of many over-worked, over-done drums that have been drummed many times.  I hate this show. I hate that it presents itself as a voice for Latin America.  And no Carlos, I am not trying to censore you. If people like it, then keep it on. But I personally think that it\\'s a bad show.',\n",
       " b'I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp\\'s story is a B film, the casting of Loy, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.  Before Loy became MGM\\'s reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy\\'s follow-up film to EMMA, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler).  Loy\\'s Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins\\' version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy\\'s Becky is very much a pre-Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. It\\'s the type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. That\\'s what makes her fallen character so tragic.  In counterpoint to Loy\\'s grasping Becky is the goody goody Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is just not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are nearly Dickensian is their quirkiness: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as the housekeeper.  Loy is front and center throughout. While the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman\\'s winning roulette bet. The more Loy\\'s Becky descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally \"caught.\" Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a film that should be seen.',\n",
       " b\"Flipper is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family. It's obviously not a great movie, Free Willy looks much better almost in every component of film making. Possibly, at times it becomes a bit naive , and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie, but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can make bad movie watchable, okay movie - good, good - great and great movie becomes all time classic. Paul Hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role. As I already say above, whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots definitely is the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way if you want to see nice, sweet and entertaining movie. If you like me become sick and tired of modern Hollywood trash, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity you most likely would like this movie.   My rating: 7,7 out of 10.

       " b\"Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) recounts the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ub amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century Korea.  However, the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society.  Jang seong-ub is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul. This characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to invoke the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink, erections, and desire.  Although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film, the emotional complexity of Jang is still played in a constantly oscillating manner building to the films' finale. Interestingly, the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes seamlessly transition from one time and location to another without any conventional 'cues' to the audience that such a scene change will occur. For example, many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location.  The visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also oscillates from stark (and perhaps bleak) black and white scenery to more colorful and alive environments that again parallel the paintings of Jang either in simple black ink on white paper or with color added. Rainbows of color enter the film at points as the artist observes nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings.  The theme of an artist's individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society arises in the film through various points including class distinction, the domination of government over the artist, the accepted norms of the artistic elite, and the base desires of the common masses. Instead of creating his own completely original works, Jang finds himself mostly recreating masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. The question thus arises if recreation itself deserves artistic merit.  I wish that I was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story - but beyond any comparison to the current role of Korean government in artistic expression and/or censorship I cannot comment.  Overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking. A great film to see and then ponder over.\",\n",
       " b\"According to the blurb on the back of the DVD case; Jonothan Ross 'laughed until a little bit of wee came out'. I suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it.  I never watched the series for one reason or another, so maybe I'm missing some essential cues. As to this movie; I watched the first 45 minutes or so. I laughed once, smiled once, then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen. Nothing did.  Evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post-Python, gross-humour style, this one falls absolutely flat. There's been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years, not the least of which were 'Bottom', 'The Fast Show' 'The Vicar Of Dibley' and 'Father Ted', each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches. Any one of these could knock this crap into a cocked hat.  If the series was anything like this movie; I'm surprised they got the funding. Happily it was one of those \\xc2\\xa32 Tesco bran-tub purchases and is now in the local charity shop.  The moral of the story is; don't believe the pundits, never pay top dollar.\",\n",

I watched it all disbelieving what I was watching, wasn't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming? Mix the most hammed performances from the most wooden actors, an abysmal script were every comment from all of the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried (and failed bigtime) to give the film a forced pace. All these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return. Avoid at EVERY cost.\",\n",

Also, when Moe and Larry throw the darts in order to \"slow the bull down so he can get off\", that\\'s lifted right from the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry \"magically\" appear 15 years younger. Why oh why did Moe allow all this to happen? It\\'s a burning question that probably can never be answered because as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather high standards for his work, as also did Larry, Curly and Shemp.

More period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies just also happen to feature one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There's not a single facet of these gems that is unpolished, from the scenario(s) to the performances to the filmmaker's craftsmanship. Even the special effects are handled with well-above-average skill, and are integrated (in most instances) almost seamlessly into the movie(s). If you're a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.\",\n",
       " b'\\'Boogie Nights\\' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America\\'s shameful past, which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth. Its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors, involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in Hollywood, and all-too-often exploited by the press. It seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence -- the American Dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls.  Dirk Diggler\\'s dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset on his body. Dirk\\'s real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. After falling out with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading \"actor\" in most of Horner\\'s films. With newfound success, Eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler is born.  Eddie/Dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with \\'Wonderland\\', which starred Val Kilmer. \\'Boogie Nights\\' is unarguably the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: regular cinema-goers.  The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography -- filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. In a way, the film\\'s director -- Paul Thomas Anderson -- implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in American history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. Anderson\\'s style is so deep, and so distinct, that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first-hand. Not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film.  All was not happy on the set of \\'Boogie Nights\\'. Prior to filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly disowning it, before being nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddenly shutting up. A year before, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney/Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. He essentially lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words \"boogie nights\" into his movie through the mouth of a character.  The casting of the film is one of its finest aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson regulars are here, as well as a whole top-notch cast of first-timers. To name some of the more well-known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire movie essentially borders down to Mark Wahlberg, as Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. This is his best role to date.  Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. When Jack Horner first meets Eddie, Anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows Jack and Amber into a night club, where most of the characters are first introduced. It reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in Robert Altman\\'s \\'The Player\\' -- it works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. His style is fast-paced in the vein of Martin Scorsese, where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed. Incidentally, Anderson references two classic Scorsese shots -- the closing De Niro mirror speech from \\'Raging Bull\\' and the tracking nightclub scene from \\'GoodFellas\\'. Anderson is a young, growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction, despite his age. Whereas his first feature film, \\'Hard Eight\\', was noticeably wise and poignant, \\'Boogie Nights\\' is even more so.  \\'Boogie Nights\\' began as an effort of love on Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s account. Having filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson\\'s film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content, occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than such trash. It is a blazing, wonderful modern-day masterpiece that is as mind-numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. Arguably Anderson\\'s best film and among the greatest -- and most important -- projects of the last decade.',\n",

       " b'Surface, from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On one hand, it seemed so high-concept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture (or several). Plus, it felt like it was NBC\\'s attempt at a \"Lost-killer\". On the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of Lost seemed intrigued.  So, after one (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault, on Sci-fi, or filling a gap in NBC\\'s lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. Its ratings were some of the better on the network (which isn\\'t saying much), but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its future.  So, is it worthwhile? Yes.  Surface follows a continuing story format, driven by plot with next to no filler episodes. Almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot, much like a motion picture. No filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. Yet, the show\\'s double-edge helped made up for that; Big things seem to happen every episode, but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you\\'re left wanting more! That trait of the show, though shows how great it is. The cast is solid; the three main leads, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, put in a solid performance every episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding/studying the creatures. The supporting cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and the brief performance by Rade Serbedzija fill out the cast well. The story is slow to start (my one regret; it doesn\\'t really pick up until a 3-4 episodes in to the short 15-episode season), but the latter half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are stunning (one\\'s jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures \\'attack\\' a ship), as well.  Many of the show\\'s problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode.  In short, if you\\'ve missed the first season and you\\'re curious, go back and watch it. It\\'s no Twin Peaks in terms of quirkiness, but the high-concept nature of it puts in in league with that, Lost, and other similar shows, with a flair for action and adventure. Enjoy it.',\n",

Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.  This is their take on their \"manufactured image\" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.  It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.  See it with an open mind.',\n",
       " b'This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovsk\\xc3\\xbd is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its details. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who\\'s trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.  Marcela (Anna Geislerov\\xc3\\xa1), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Lukn\\xc3\\xa1r) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There\\'s no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda\\'s garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.  \"Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,\" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though Prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He\\'s here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes\\' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn\\'t prevent Jarda from going off to jail.  In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena\\'s present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn\\'t sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes\\'s whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough.   Clearly the \"good angel,\" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It\\'s only at the end, when he\\'s pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won\\'t lie down and be walked over.   Also to be dealt with is Jarda\\'s religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck.   The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film \\'Once,\\' including the latter\\'s theme song, \"Falling.\" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from \\'Once\\'--though this film came first.  Hrebejk\\'s people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn\\'t necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela\\'s conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It\\'s fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves\\'s poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda\\'s annoyingly pious mother (Em\\xc3\\xadlia V\\xc3\\xa1s\\xc3\\xa1ryov\\xc3\\xa1). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from \"India\" purported to be from his dad, who\\'s in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in. This seems a world in which you can\\'t see the forest for the trees.',\n",

Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a dumb killer, dull and boring deaths, boring scenery, and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. Did I already mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie.  Cheerleader Massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is utter garbage!\",\n",
       " b'Let me depart from many comments I\\'ve read here, and say that this film ranks as one of the five best Bonds, along with On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Licence To Kill, and For Your Eyes Only (the ONLY time Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of futzing around). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together -- as co-writer, co-producer, and in his best performance since From Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic, and obviously enjoying himself. His acting is mature, confident, and laced with the right amount of humour. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his jowly, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever!  This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball, without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot. This cast is far superior, as well. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eyepatch, SPECTRE ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and lovely, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original, and the addition of the bumbling agent Small-Fawcett is fun without lapsing into slapstick.  Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously fans will miss the gun-barrel trademark and the 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions.  Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (at the health spa) being particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember the music for Moonraker? I personally would rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To a Kill!  The Eon folks can sneer at this film if they like. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery\\'s mature 007 didn\\'t swing through the jungle emitting a Tarzan yell. He did not frolic with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight off \"Indian\" snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon\\'s desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman put together a fine film, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated.  If, however, you would rather see James Bond get kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in another tiresome struggle with \"Jaws\", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a slapstick firetruck chase through San Francisco, this is NOT the film for you!',\n",

This film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this film. It has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and I think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics.

Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of \"The King and I\" interjected, besides). Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue, and both seem singularly without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don\\'t know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurry, noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but a loser to John Williams\\' \"Jaws\"), fine location shooting and cinematography. *1/2 from ****',\n",
       " b'To regard the film as nothing more than a documentary about skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well- known skateboarding figure himself) has crafted a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio- cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained wide appeal. In addition, his film is rather personal: Peralta\\'s first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic investigator and the involved participant-subject. In this role, he is a quintessential \"participant-observer,\" while gathering together a wide array of personalities whom were integral to this movement and those who were profoundly affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film employs a uniquely stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narration (by Sean Penn) and interviews adopt a rather genuine, unrehearsed form that is akin with the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of sidewalk surfing. The film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a protracted sporting, music video tempered with an archaeologist\\'s sensitivity to the importance of time, place, and circumstance.',\n",
       " b'That this film has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need any more reminders of America\\'s obsession with the greed creed? The topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort, but will respond with barely concealed rage. It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and smashing it into a thousand pieces.  What\\'s really irksome with these kinds of films, including \"Purpose\", is their pretense that behind the glitter, there\\'s some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile. In \"Purpose\", I found no such meaningful message. What I did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseating in their glibness, do very little actual work. Instead, they party, they play golf, they strut their coolness, they sound \"hip\" with dialogue straight out of MTV-culture-speak: \"rock my world\", and \"Now get back to partying; that\\'s an order\". John is smug, self-important, shallow, and smirks a lot. Robert, who wears funky little glasses, is even worse.  The film includes two youthful garage geeks, who look and sound like they\\'re right out of the film \"Antitrust\" (2001). Stereotypes are played for all they\\'re worth, and in this film also include chic-looking computer equipment, and Barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can-do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-duty partying. And with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates, can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years?  About the best I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of San Francisco. The film would have been a lot more enjoyable, a lot more entertaining, if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story, and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film\\'s duration.',\n",

Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date.

That is excellent. If you are a Bath fan like myself, you\\'ll love watching this film! The performances may sound a bit too \"melodramatic\" but I\\'ve got the impression that this film, like the novel itself, is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period. The only drawback is probably the female lead as I personally have another idea of Catherine Morland\\'s physical appearance.

Unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest, which is the main reason that I was tricked into watching it. I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. It is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the Carleton Hendricks did in this film. The sad part is that NO one does this stuff to themselves. Marilyn freakin' Manson doesn't even go that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music (that would be a stab at Snider himself), it is more like Dee Snider was trying to raise himself from the career-dead and present himself as a sick-minded individual once more. Dee, it seems that the time has come to let it all die...\",\n",
       " b'This is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for graduation and decides to take it for a spin in the local town. Rich boy meets poor girl in \\'Mabels Diner\\'who is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out. There is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the Rich boy and Poor boy wind up having to do Community Service as ordered by the town judge. Rich boy and Poor boy just do not get along and the Rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy\\'s girl friend. There are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life. Poor Girl says, \"Some people go through life and never find Love, I can say that I found love and am holding on to It\". You will need some tissue\\'s if you are sensitive, there are plenty of romantic scenes and I doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end. The producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film. If you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects, this is your film.',\n",
       " b'This is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average Asylum film. It was a lot better than I thought it would be, is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film.   The voice on the telephone is really creepy - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film, since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator.  The action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film, it becomes vertiginous; there is not much gore in this film, just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention.   I gave this movie a 8/10 because some clich\\xc3\\xa9s.',\n",

After, I went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. I must say that I was extremely disappointed! I found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including Jessie saying, \"I know Daddy, but I hurt so much inside\" after Leslie dies. It was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. I watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. The story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.',\n",

So he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squad, before they find them.  Then the movie goes on to a romance, gun shooting, and voodoo.

       " b\"The first movie at the Fangoria Festival in Vegas and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. A number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This picture seemed determined to do its own thing.  Tom Savini showed some comic chops as the over the top villain. He dominated every scene he was in, flipping his cape about like Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanation after the film. He had such a good sense of humor about the role.  I was glad I didn't have too many preconceptions going in, because the movie offered a lot of surprises. The story was funny and profane and unusual. There was a lot of love lavished on the look. Most important, it had a weird edge to it. Unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a movie that used its look for a purpose.  There were a lot of movies at the Fangoria Festival with bigger budgets, but none that dared to be this different.\",\n",
       " b'The film opens in a stuffy British men\\'s club full of gents in leather chairs smoking cigars. This is Denistoun\\'s world. A messenger delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The site of the earrings sets off a reminiscence about the time he spent in the company of gypsies. The rest of the film is flashback.  Golden Earrings has been a long time favorite of mine and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against her usual type. Here she\\'s dark-haired, earthy and not in the least bit mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she\\'a tower of strength and energetically sets out to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach his goal. To make sure that he\\'s a really convincing gypsy, she pierces his ears and has him wear her dead lover\\'s golden earrings. With his clothes and some grease, she transforms him from an effete British gentleman into a wild and sexy looking man.   When I was growing up I used to hear the song \"Golden Earrings\" which is sung in the film. I think the tune is hummed a little by Dietrich. /There\\'s a story the gypsies know is true /That when your love wears golden earrings /She belongs to you.',\n",

Otherwise, stay away from it at all costs. It\\'s the stupidest movie I\\'ve ever seen.  Everything\\'s stupid--the story, script, and especially the acting, everything! While watching the movie you\\'ll either turn the TV off and think \"how can a movie be so sadly stupid\", or keep on watching from curiosity, to see if things can get more stupid than this (they can\\'t).  These movie makers (if you can call them that) need to seriously go back to their day jobs, not one of them has an ounce of talent, and I highly doubt you can make a living churning out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to see!

Kate Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich, handsome husband (Robert Taylor)is not the dreamboat she married but a psychotic killer. MGM\\'s attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid, muddled, ludicrous script, and the idiotic casting of Hepburn as a jeopardized woman fearing for her life (who could ever imagine Hepburn afraid of anything?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli he was directing a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, also cast-against-type as a good guy, retains his dignity in a quiet, low-keyed performance. Karl Freund\\'s ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty--and was wasted on the wrong film. End result: Metro\\'s \"Parnell\" of the 1940s.',\n",
       " b\"At the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and it was at the police ballistics lab.   But where did the gun under the hood, used in the demonstration, come from? Wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did Columbo's cops replicate the camera/gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do that without breaking and entering the car? Perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo have replicated their camera/gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob? Columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it re-planted under the hood of the car, and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting.  This was a 10/10 show until this glaring plot error at the end.\",\n",

Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances (particularly by Robin Evans, oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls). The script isn't razor sharp, but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings somewhat bearable. ** from ****\",\n",
       " b\"This has got to be one of Australia's best productions. I completely disagree with the comments made by 'RamiNour101'.  This series shows the depth of Australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out. Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is a great example of this and it really captures the Australian spirit.  The music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with, their longing for home and their loved ones. The numerous amusing renditions of The Road to Gundagai captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while.  As for the comment about it being racist towards Japanese people, the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened. The Japanese did treat the Australians very poorly in Changi and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed. The comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false. These six stories that are told in the series are composed from real P.O.W experiences.  The actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was gut wrenching. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. We see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of The Secret Nine.  Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group, to being sick, weak and unable to take care of himself. The displays of mateship in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be Australian.  I study WWII at university level and have found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an Australian Soldier.  Well done to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.\",\n",
       " b\"Whether or not this adaptation of the Marvel comic was made \\xc2\\x96 and shelved \\xc2\\x96 so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters, it doesn't change the fact that it's utter rubbish. The Dr. Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can't even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman's POV, the dialogue is absolutely dismal, the team's costumes don't fit properly, and the effects are appalling: the Human Torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens, while Mr. Fantastic's powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release, it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good.\",\n",
       " b'This is one of the rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. This wasn\\'t because it had particularly entranced or impressed me. The contrary, it had given me nothing at all.  Why? Because somehow, everything was so much overdone that I couldn\\'t take this film seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness, rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime.  Baise-moi had been described as \"Thelma & Louise with actual sex\" to me. Well, it is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because they\\'ve committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now, that the police are going to catch them, and they decide that now that everything\\'s over anyway, there is no way to hold back.  Baise-moi had been described as a feminist film where women, who had suffered from male dominance in the past, exact revenge upon the men that they encounter.  This is something that I had never interpreted into this film, simply because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they do not just kill irresponsible, violent men, but also men that they seduce themselves, men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous, brutal ways.  How easily the \"heroines\" decide to murder, and how much pleasure they take in it, made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. It was just all too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than in conveying a story, or making a point.  Baise-moi left me with no impression, hadn\\'t set me thinking, because it was so far removed from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic and over the top.  There was nothing that I could do with this film, there was simply nothing about it to think about, other than \"Why did they make this terrible film?\" Had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film, served a purpose, I\\'d easily accepted it. But since I found nothing, since the film\\'s story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film... I filed it away under \"unnecessary torture\", decided to never ever, EVER, watch this film again, and I now consider this to be the worst film I\\'ve ever seen.   Worst, not just because it really isn\\'t my cup of tea to watch people get raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill one another... but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film... if they wanted to say anything at all... it just didn\\'t work. And there\\'s nothing else that could save this film, because it\\'s also filmed in such an ugly style.',\n",
       " b'Two Hands restored my faith in Aussie films. It took an old premise and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie to no end. I recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie films. Bryan Brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role tailor made for him. Ledger was adequtely dumb and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.',\n",
       " b'Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. Ricci is my favorite actress: She is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates, which gives credence to the often misapplied term \"star.\"   The film misses its mark for lots of various reasons, but perhaps most notably for the story\\'s seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative...more on that later. The cast at first glance is excellent, but come to think of it, Jessica Lang as the Jewish mother is too Protestant and not exactly right, Ann Hetch doesn\\'t come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book, and when your making a movie, how can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the film\\'s construction: first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the Elizabeth Wurtzle character, and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in.   Unfortunately do to the flashback construction, Lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. This is a major problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist\\'s couch. She is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both society and the home, and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case. She is so talented, and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on, that one\\'s heart can\\'t help but reach out to her due to her victimization. This is missed on the film.  Ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of one severely affected girl, but also it is a film about a nation who can\\'t get its act together; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at Harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee. The film finally isn\\'t able to get either of these messages across compellingly, and that\\'s too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can\\'t function without a chemical crutch? These are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but that doesn\\'t have the effect it\\'s suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes.  Ricci\\'s performance is tight and heartfelt, and one of the best of her acting career.  Michele Williams is also superb in her role.',\n",
       " b'This could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made, up there in a league with movies like \"Howard the Duck,\" \"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\" and \"Ishtar.\" I don\\'t understand why I decided to see this movie, as it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why one would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. The acting is among the worst I\\'ve ever seen, as is the writing. The characters are all stupid, and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie. Tom Arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever-- this movie proves it. There is nothing worthy about this movie. Don\\'t rent it, don\\'t watch it, don\\'t even say that it looks interesting. It\\'s bad enough I saw it.',\n",

He is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed. His master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of. If added to his participation we add the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by Spain's greatest writer besides Miguel de Cervantes(Don Quijote de la Mancha). The story in itself is superb: Nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very Christian life, but as always there are people that do not accept this. He wanders through many places preaching his Christianity but finding, most of the time, people that do not accept him. But besides the splendid story, it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver.\",\n",

I don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. I am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. If he did think he was making a thriller, then he has by a stroke of luck, created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's Hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).  Its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! I am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10..

Personally I have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. To my immense disappointment, it was not.  The script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they\\'re reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. I couldn\\'t even finish watching it. It is even worse than \"Witch Academy\", and that\\'s quite a feat in itself.  I cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.  Painful, awful, horrendous.',\n",
       " b\"Clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Charles Bukowski's work. The autobiographical Henry Chinaski character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987's 'Barfly', also starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should certainly see 'Barfly' to get a better look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of Bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. The inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of Chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for Dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked Rourke. Rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place-setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer. Dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting, handsome, relatively clean-looking wanna-be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of Chinaski's story. Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. The women in 'Factotum' can't hold a candle to Dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'Factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to Bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip-off from 'Barfly').  If you want to see the best Bukowski stories on film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (which also goes by the title 'Crazy Love').\",\n",
       " b\"New Year's Day. The day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and I discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of January. We had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas?  We elected for the digital freebie since the DVDs are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X-Files beginning to end. The Drive-In channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well-reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for House of the Damned.  To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's over-written Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters!  The acting, especially by Evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and I dissolved in laughter.  Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5\",\n",
       " b'In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short, we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed \"Serpentine Dance\" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.  Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.  Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era. Supposedly, the Moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone (including refilming). The version available to us now may be a later version/remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City. She later went on to star as the \"Gibson Bathing Girl\" in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912.  The short is notable for its framing of motion, which, especially during the \"second half\", becomes almost abstract. It somewhat resembles a Morris Louis painting, even though this is almost 60 years before Louis\\' relevant work.  You should be able to find this short on DVD on a number of different anthologies of early films.',\n",
       " b\"With No Dead Heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his buddy Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. Fast forward ten years and Harry is now a brainwashed Russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene hilt by Nick Nicholson who might I add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a Russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film. Soon William is re-recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry down. He teams up with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated Ivan's El Salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. One such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by William and Barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music I've ever heard. Who would strip completely nude in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the end theme from Blood on Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. In one scene Harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. I had to rewind it and count. Hard to find film that has recently gotten the full HD treatment by MGM. Track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.\",\n",
       " b\"Granted, HOTD 2 is better than the Uwe Boll crapfest that was the first one, but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. OK OK, I'm being a little bit harsh with this one, its just that Video Game adaptations of Zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish. The first HOTD was entertaining crap more than anything else; Uwe Boll saw to that. And HOTD 2 was...better? The entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but... this is it? The script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. But in the script dwells horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clich\\xc3\\xa9s, and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the Bollmeister very, very proud. But, it could've been worse right?  HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. As you may guess, it all goes to sh*t. A nearby College Campus seems to be the center for the Zombie (or Hypersapien?) epidemic, and as you may expect, a group of Commandos and two Zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No, it ain't blowing sh*t up. Instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. Between this and that lays bland character interactions, an insufferable amount of clich\\xc3\\xa9s (but hey, at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed), and decent looking Zombies.   The acting is passable. Who would've thought that Sticky Fingaz was a passable actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine somewhat as the leads. And the supporting cast was passable too. It was all passable.   The make up effects on the Zombies were alright, it could've been worse like in the first HOTD: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. The gore was alright too. Cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid as f*ck, but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect.   Overall, this movie will appeal only to Zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap Horror movie for the weekend. Apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending, but I wouldn't count on it. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4.\",\n",
       " b\"We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. I've seen that Junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID!!\",\n",
       " b\"This is first of all a good, exciting story, with well developed characters. But all the other details are well crafted on top of that, leading to a wonderful film. Don't let the Disney label lead you to think this is dumbed-down or only for kids -- it has a lot to offer to all ages, whether you like golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. And speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on TV, this is no small feat.  The first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds, enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through. Sure, you root for Ouimet's character all along, but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right. The background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs, since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses.  The computer effects are flashy, but they do help the story more often than not. The directing has all sorts of clever golf shots, and the period costumes and sets are really top notch.  There are a few small quibbles -- many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold, but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn.  Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is, as usual, callow and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, playing Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and minor changes of expression say so much.  Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. After you see the film, Google to find the actual photograph of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament, to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was.\",\n",
       " b'Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Even though his background was mostly comedy, he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better (though there is a lot of humour in this). Hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent especially since his character is supposed to be English but that\\'s just a minor thing.  All the villains are equally well cast: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O\\'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants, they are 100% believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear e.g. the Lilliputians\\' unremitting suspicion of Gulliver, Grildrig the (giant) dwarf\\'s hatred of him for usurping his position as court jester, Dr. Bates\\' attempt to have Gulliver proved insane so he can marry Mary.  Mary Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver (another 17th Century English character with an American accent but never mind). She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does, he is talking about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very believable character.  The special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall.  The cameos are great as well: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson\\'s superb acting ability.  The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things: a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive, disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is. Gulliver and Mistress\\' study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos.  The best version of \"Gulliver\\'s Travels\" by far and one of the best mini-series ever.',\n",
       " b\"I saw this at The Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure either of my kids really got the movie, but I have to say that it was a wonderful short film.  'Nostradamus and Me' is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980's, which in turn, extends to how my kids feel today. Then, we had Regan, today, we got Bush. Instead of Nuclear War, we have Terrorism.  I really identified with the main character, and I myself dated a 'Curehead' in high school. We all felt like 'nothing mattered' when we were 16, but it's great to see a film where they discover that everything matters!!!   Again, I probably wouldn't have put this in the family section...there were a few too many curse words for younger children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch.\",\n",
       " b'Hilarious from start to finish, there\\'s got to be great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile, specially when two funeral parlors are battling for control of the market: a classic parlor and a revolutionary one where every funeral is a show, lead by Christopher Walken, a treat in the role of the visionary american mortitian. But the rest of the cast is great also, and this one is another success that only UK is capable of making. Surprising among the ensemble cast is Naomi Watts, that strikes in another metamorphosis (accent included). Always sporting a smile on its face, it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called \"Four Funerals and One Wedding\", but you\\'ll understand when you see it.',\n",

       " b\"Am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else .. this film was terrible. I'm a fan of all 3 series of the league of gentelmen and have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in series 3. This film however was a blatant half effort, the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero. There was about 5 moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end. This would have been better as a 10 minute short on the DVD .. it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do, and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first 30 minutes.  If your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you'll hate this film. If you only watch it cause there was nothing better on TV then u'll love it.  someone back me up !!\",\n",
       " b\"Perhaps it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but I believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were in, but, since they are not professional actors, they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers. There were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory I will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which I can't remember.   Watch this if you want a first-hand account of the .com bust and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who didn't become instant millionares. However, be prepared for some nauseating camera work, poor acting, poor dialogue, and an overall bad movie that epitomizes the era of the Internet boom.\",\n",
       " b\"WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are Wright as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.\",\n",
       " b\"Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also The Floorwalker in this category.  Charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.  There aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. For the rest, quite disappointing.  4/10.\",\n",
       " b\"... because while I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it seems from other user comments that I'm in the minority.

       " b\"Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allows the stronger voice to be Helmut Berger's! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the Master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all. The beautiful images belong to Visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of Berger and Zeffirelli to Adam Low's tiny little world. A must to avoid!\",\n",
       " b'Very strange. But meant to be. This director is his own man. Even through there are strains if Polanski, Bergman, and Kafka at least in the episode no 6, the peeping tom one. What made it all so strange, and reminiscent of the above three artists, was that it went all over the place, you never knew where it was headed, and could have ended anyplace, and finally when it did end, could have kept going. The ending is hardly a finality, nobody could tell you what these two characters would be doing in even the next frame. One other thing should be said about the director: No wonder Kubrick found him fascinating. There is a lot of Eyes Wide Shut in this episode somehow, in the direct approach to character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without any of the stark effects, much more washed out, and hurried, not as fussed over. That said, back to the beginning, still this guy has his own things to say and says them well. Yet, for some reason, there is not a single scene I ever want to see again. But definitely did not feel ripped off in the least watching it one time around. But I did keep getting the feeling of three or four other directors ghosts moving through the parade, blurring everything. The caveat being that it was only episode six: the other nine might give me entirely different takes. But since this episode revolved around peeping, looking, the absolute domain of film, I will say this, he took none of the usual routes, definitely went his own way while carrying the baggage of a lot of good directors behind him.',\n",
       " b'My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance must have been desperate for work to have lent their talents to this turkey. A horribly muddled story about satanism in modern day Greece, Land Of The Minotaur (aka The Devil\\'s Men) is a misfire on more-or-less every level imaginable. It has precious few scares (always a slight flaw for a \"horror\" movie, don\\'t you think?); weak performances; countless scenes where characters foolishly wander off alone or turn down the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group; and some rather irritating editing techniques which add nothing whatsoever to the proceedings. I got prematurely excited at the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends - but this film isn\\'t worth getting remotely excited about; it\\'s a huge let-down and rather an embarrassment for its much worthier leads.  In a remote region of Greece, outsiders such as tourists and archaeologists keep going missing, and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something sinister is afoot. He writes to his friend, New York private eye Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), asking him to fly out to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. In the meantime, three more visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), who are all personal friends of Father Roche - go missing while snooping around nearby Greek ruins. Milo eventually arrives in Greece, but is initially dubious about Father Roche\\'s beliefs that the missing people have been snatched for satanic sacrifices. Milo and Father Roche are also joined by Laurie (Luan Peters), the girlfriend of missing man Tom. Together, they uncover the activities of a Minoan devil-worshipping cult headed by creepy Carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazed cultists have been busily sacrificing their victims to a statue of the minotaur. Furthermore, they seemingly cannot be killed by normal means, so Father Roche has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them.  Land Of The Minotaur should have been much better than it actually is. The plot is so wacky and improbable that it has all the hallmarks of an enjoyably goofy cult/camp favourite. But the handling is just awful. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to link the narrative together cohesively, so the whole thing progresses like it was being made up on a day-to-day basis. He also has no idea how to coax convincing performances from his cast, so they are left to embarrass themselves in either dreadfully hammy (Pleasance, Cushing) or dreadfully amateurish (Skouras, Peters) performances. What\\'s worse is that the narrative makes no sense. Why would Father Roche seek help from a private eye who is utterly flippant about his beliefs? How does Roche know that the sacrifices only occur during a full moon? How can the minotaur statue speak? Why is one one of the sacrificial victims instructed during a vision to stab Father Roche, only to herself be stabbed a few scenes later before getting a chance to carry it out? And - most baffling of all - why does Father Roche drag Milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and and some holy water to dispose of the bad guys? These questions - and more - will pop into your mind during Land Of The Minotaur.... but, alas, there are no answers to be had. Frustrating, dumb and disappointing!',\n",

       " b\"The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84). But it has a dated look to it. Maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984. Now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of Gypsies burned to death. But one of their children survive (our monster) so flash forward to present day which would be 1978, we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the Monster. The tag line for this picture claims ITS NOT HUMAN, AND ITS GOT AN AXE, but an Axe was only used in these first two killings. Now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping. We all know they are the Prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one. For an 80 minute movie it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins. Overall for being out into an 80-'s horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever. Hey the Prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short.. It does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him. Side note, the monster has gone on to star in the Addams family movies in the 1990's..\",\n",
       " b\"I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in truth, the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made-for-Disney movies have been. The story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type. The acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but I give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with.  However, it's inexcusable, in my book, to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life. If the girl can't sing, have someone who can record the music!  This actress is a TERRIBLE singer - she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key!\",\n",
       " b\"Such a BS movie. It's just some stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a completely BS plot, not in any way related to the book.   It looks like the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie, than they will ever be able to get from selling the movie. The plot of the movie includes references to some of the real recent events in Russian and other parts of Eastern Europe, but puts them in such way that has nothing to do with reality. It looks like the movie is a brainwashing instrument, which helps to portray Russia as a place populated by evil people that always dream about killing someone.   An of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of USSR instead of Russia when running news reports, showing a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting that it's Russian elections, etc.   Also there are many bizarre episodes (i.e. a character runs though the Red Square in Moscow and in a second he is in downtown Sophia, Bulgaria).\",\n",
       " b'If you think about it, it\\'s nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty (one of the world\\'s most controversial topics) that offends neither those for nor against. It\\'s a testament to Tim Robbins\\' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well (Shawshank Redemption, Jacob\\'s Ladder).  This film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the \"for\" and \"against\" camps... so subtle that it can\\'t be put into words, subtle to the point of vanishing, yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible, that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough...',\n",
       " b'The story was well plotted and interesting by itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. To avoid that, I am not going to talking the story here.  I regard this film as a good adaption of Sarah Water\\'s book, as compared with the previous one \"Tipping the velvet\". I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. The film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course, due to the time limitation, the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part III of the book. Therefore, it couldn\\'t illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs\\'s place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). Despite that, the film actually did a good job in representing the story. It really worth watching. It\\'s still unclear when BBC-America can broadcast this film. That\\'s pity.  PS: noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses.',\n",
       " b\"In general, I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, nearly indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? And why, when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances, too. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was poor to bad, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.\",\n",
       " b'Two movies: \"the fifth element\", \"armageddon\". The same subject: to save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: \"Armageddon\" is very inferior to Luc Besson\\'s film. Some spectacular special effects don\\'t succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think about the president\\'s speech and especially Willis\\' relationship with his daughter, \"Grace\". At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. Then, at the end of the movie, it\\'s true love and understanding that shine in him. On another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn\\'t work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the \"fifth element\", the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. The movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his \"fifth element\"\\'s character. He plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he\\'s unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, Willis\\' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here just for having fun. One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She\\'s at the NASA just to be decorative.  When the movie was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.',\n",
       " b'Crack House (1989) was one of the few film during the 80\\'s that falls into this genre. What\\'s supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. There\\'s nothing wrong with that however. The video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard \"turncoat\" Roundtree,  The movie follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them get\\'s turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie\\'s \"Mister Big\", he\\'s one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well.  If you like hard edge sleaze then this movie\\'s for you.

If you\\'d like a long version of how terrible this movie is, please read the review by coinlightning.  Here\\'s the short version: shameless use of the actors\\' NAMES to propel the plot as opposed to using their talent (no one brought their \"A game\" to this), blatant commercialism (I guess Pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement - or 40 - into a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so convoluted with \"rock star\" clich\\xc3\\xa9s that it was totally ridiculous.  Let me put it to you this way . . . I was thinking of \\'Wayne\\'s World\\' the whole time I was watching this movie, but I wasn\\'t laughing! Anytime you try to throw in Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your movie plot along you\\'ve got SERIOUS problems.  PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.',\n",
       " b\"I watched Sleeper Cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly, it created depth and substance to almost every character. Oded Fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene he's in\\xc2\\x97and even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well, though in some scenes I wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.  The pros of the series are the two leads, Fehr and Ealy, the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons, for me personally, were that the female T&A was overkill\\xc2\\x97most seemed gratuitous, as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. He's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.\",\n",
       " b'My original comment on this particular title was deleted, by a IMDb user or the staff, only because I just happen to dislike this film to the point I had to sincerely write what I felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film. where\\'s my freedom of word?  Obviously this movie was made by students, \\'cos so lame and amateurish it felt. Of course even they have to start from somewhere? The script was incoherent mess and so was the acting. With low budget and b- class actors, what can you expect? There\\'s some CGI in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old PC. Some may say, this is sort of an \"Alien\" clone, only this time it\\'s Dracula (in a vintage costume) who\\'s sucking the other cast dry, one by one. The sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space craft.   It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought about the film after it was released... Coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever!  It was a total waste of my time and money, don\\'t know why I even bothered to rent this flick. Honestly, I just hate this film. With Uwe Boll\\'s House Of The Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I\\'ve seen even worse than these two)  Avoid! Any other film will do better.',\n",
       " b'Mind you, it\\'s not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn\\'t really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.  A poor film on par with the greats like \"Gymkata\" and \"The Pumaman,\" \"No Holds Barred\" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. Well maybe the stakes aren\\'t all that high...and quite frankly I feel dirty just calling these people \"professionals\" at anything. And really, except for the first scene, there\\'s no wrestling to speak of. So I guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating-the-c***-out-of-people. Sounds good, right?  Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the champion of the WWF (Never let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typecast, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents). Essentially he\\'s playing himself, but with a wardrobe that\\'s more black and blue than the Hulkster\\'s red and yellow. He also has this hand gesture he does. It\\'s kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts, except you stick your thumb in the air, and you curl your index finger in. My friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an \"R.\" Try and see for yourself. If that looks like an \"R,\" well, then, Mars needs women. But anyway.  Kurt Fuller, with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz, plays a TV exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting Rip, who\\'s evidentally bigger than Elvis, on his network. He won\\'t have any of it (And exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera), and so the movie follows Fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at Rip. He does so when he creates his brilliantly titled \"Battle of the Tough Guys.\" Marketing genius, this guy.  From the numerous hand gestures, to the rather idiotic fight scenes (All played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious) to the overacting, to the far too frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but undies, this movie has everything you\\'d ever want in a dumb movie. It\\'s frivolous, not too taxing on the mind, violent, and includes the phrase \"What\\'s that smell?\" \"DOOKIE!\" \"Dookie?\"  A classic for all time.',\n",
       " b\"I'd be hard pressed to say what is it that makes this film so important to me. While a very good movie, this is definitely not the most outstanding Fassbinder's film. Still along with the American Soldier it keeps making it into my personal list of favorites whenever I get to thinking about it.\",\n",
       " b\"this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason. the eerie music was well written but other than that, its a complete waste of time, and it REALLY disturbed me.... I'm not really sure why either.... if you just want to see a bad 'B' horror movie, i guess you could give it a shot, but only as a last resort\",\n",
       " b\"This is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks. In this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world. Although there are lows, including an orphan penguin, all in all it's a great family film.\",\n",
       " b'A fantastic film featuring great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran, Sam Neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank\\'s uni professor and new talent Matt Newton gave a performance which will have people saying, \" you know, Bert Newton, Matt\\'s dad!\" Get out and see this movie!!!',\n",
       " b\"I go this game and it is alright I guess. I just expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. Also the graphics aren't as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst out of the three. I haven't played the first one but have played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. This game deserves a 4/10 though. Could do with some improvements.\",\n",
